NEW YOUTUBE SOURCE: Excerpts from the transcript of the video "It's Fire Inside You that Builds Startups! | 3x Venture Founder, Professor - IIT| Prof. Rajen Jaswa" uploaded on the YouTube channel "GUESSS India"
entrepreneurship is so much driven by kind of what is inside a person spiring student look at product development or should they look at trends if you don't have a product or something of value in a service then it's hard to build a company around without having these two what's your philosophy that drives you shaping the destiny of young people who will become entrepreneurs and change the world in their way entrepreneur is not the genius who can creates a company but the entrepreneur is the person with the skill set to bring the resources needed to make his idea come alive good morning everyone and welcome to this session of guest cloud experts dialogue we have with us today a stalwart who has been there done that and comes with a wealth of corporate entrepreneurship as well as teaching experience on the international stage as well as back home in India and when I say back home in India I just discovered that it's not restricted to the premier institutes like IIT Bombay and IIT Gandhiad and uh the other IITs it also encompasses universities in tier 2 cities so yes our guest is Rajin Jesua and it's a real privilege to hear from him raj is a serial entrepreneur he's a Thai co-founder thai is the Indis entrepreneurs so Silicon Valley when he he's one of the earliest founders of the Thai organization and like I said earlier he is an educator at IIT as well as other universities in India in and Stanford also if I'm not wrong right Raj yeah correct so welcome Raj and thank you so much for taking time from your mad schedule for this conversation and let's explore the world of entrepreneurship from a global lens Let's dive right into it uh so thank you Herna for that generous introduction and uh I'm really gratified to get this opportunity to share you know my experiences knowledge and uh you know about entrepreneurship in any form doing it as well as teaching it because that's my passion entrepreneurship is my passion yeah absolutely absolutely so that's that's that's uh that's what uh actually drives us to passion and I would love to have you meet our entire team at a good time whenever you're in India more than welcome i'll be very happy yeah to do that so Raj uh let's dive in and I'd like to start with uh your phi
losophy what's your philosophy uh that drives you whether it is entrepreneurship teaching whether it is people management whether it is team management your own ventures what what is it that drove you yeah I mean that's a pretty deep question uh but you know if I think back as to you know the things that I've done like whether it is starting companies or teaching entrepreneurship etc i think it's not driven by things like you know fame or earning a lot of making a lot of money or uh uh you know or some or something like that it's actually driven by a sense of you know I want to make something that results in either people enjoying a new product that I bring to market or you know uh shaping the destiny of young people who will become you know entrepreneurs and you know change the world in their way so you know this my I if if I look at the drivers of my my passion or my uh desire to or my work it is really driven by trying to give back something you know it's like uh if you look at and you know we'll go through some examples of you know how I how this passion kind of ends up revealing itself so but you know I think it's more like hey we've only got this one life and you know how do we make the most of it and how do we you know end up uh having positive benefit and value to everybody that we connect with or touch or or or relate to right so it's like trying to give something back you know uh in a positive way it's uh so and entrepreneurship requires that because as you know Dr entrepreneur entrepreneurship is very hard work you know it's a very total it's a total commitment 7 by 24 every minute they there's no vacation you know you don't even think of vacation but it is something that you know kind of takes over your life right so um you better be somebody who is passionate and feels that it's adding real value to your life Because time is ultimately the one thing that we don't get one extra second in life you know so uh so time is you know we all want to use our time to you know give the maximum value to whatever we do and that is what uh drives me right thank you so Raj you you were pivotal in the way the center for entrepreneurship was set up and then it is it is now a school uh you were teaching entrepreneurs
hip and today you're a professor of practice you're consulting you're guiding you're advising uh you taught at IIT Gandhi these are all trivial institutions and then you are also teaching in universities with limited resources limited access what's difference that you have observed and how can this gap be bridged well the thing is that you know unlike uh other professions you know entrepreneurship is so much driven by um by kind of what is inside a person right it's not and um and so you know it's not a question of you know whether you can pass J or not um it's it's more a question of you How driven are you by something that motivates you right some spark or some lightning has hit you and now how driven are you to make something happen from that sudden vision or intuition that you had and I can tell you that u you know I've had excellent entrepreneurs come out of uh VNIT Nagpur I've got uh excellent entrepreneurs that I have met at uh MIT Pune at Lucky University so you know entrepreneurship you'll soon see is not about how intelligent you are and how knowledgeable you are but can you bring together the knowledge and the resources that are needed to make the vision or idea that you have come to life right so it's about bringing together like you know uh the companies that I've started you know semiconductor company then a video streaming company then a uh enterprise software company with artificial intelligence um way before AI's time and uh you know I was not the expert I was a good IT engineer a good uh technology wise but not the expert in any of these three industries but you know given the passion that I had for what we were trying to deliver whether it was a semiconductor company or a video streaming company or or a AI enterprise software company u the vision of what we wanted to deliver is something that I could bring the resources together i could bring the right engineers the right uh managers the right money the right customers the right salespeople the right marketing people i could bring together the resources needed to take the idea that was there or the germ of the idea that we had and bring it to life so entrepreneur is not the genius who can creates a company but the entrepreneur is the person w
ith the skill set to bring the resources needed to make his idea come alive right and take life right so uh there was a question which I had planned for later down but I'll bring it up now should a student entrepreneur and aspire Spiring student look at product development or should they look at a global view and look at trends and look at organizational development first well uh you know if you don't have a product or something of value in a service then it's hard to build a company around without having these two right so a product or a service that you know changes or makes people happy or makes customers happy or makes their lives easier that is the starting point you know whatever you do has to make the customer right delighted right the customer needs to get some benefit of what you're trying to do uh whether it's with a product or a service so the first thing is to understand the needs of the customer and if the customer has a need that he's you know upset about or he you know says I wish I had this fun capability and you can be alive and alert to recognize that wow he's telling me what his need is and from whatever he's doing right now it is a need that's not satisfied if you can get that insight then you can think of putting together a product or a system or a process or a business model that will address that particular need and that's what the entrepreneur does right he puts together a concept or a vision of a product or a service or a system or a business model that'll make that customer satisfied or happy that you know and then once he's happy entrepreneur has to figure out will the customer pay for this is it something that people will pay money for is it something that they can deliver for a reasonable cost so that you know there is some profit because if the business idea does not result in a profitable transaction it's not going to be easy to scale it up then it becomes a charity right so we are not bu an entrepreneur does not do charity he builds companies that you know can live off the profit profits and grow off the profits that are generated from every transaction right and entrepreneurs need to put future entrepreneurs or potential entrepreneurs need to understand this fundamental concept
correct so let me uh throw up some interesting data from the guest survey guess India survey only 14% of students want to start ventures after graduation according to the survey but 1% plan to start up after 5 years now looking at your own uh journey you you graduated from IIT Bombay moved to the US worked with a company like Cisco Cisco right uh Intel GE many companies almost 17 years I was an employee of some company or the other or a manager or something yeah and then you took the plunge for entrepreneurship then I took the plunge yes so this data s kind of kind of validates what you did so many years ago right you chose to study work and then take up entrepreneurship and here we have uh 31% of students looking at entrepreneurship in five years of professional experience i I think that is in my opinion you know that is probably a very good way to uh understand statistically you know the opportunity for entrepreneurship for students i mean to be an entrepreneur you need to have an idea or a spark or something that you become passionate about and that requires as I said an understanding of a customer's or a users's needs you know and it also requires conceptualizing some sort of a solution that would help make the customer happy you or delighted and uh you know I would say that uh you need some industry experience in whatever industry you're if you're chemical electrical you know whatever industry medical health whatever so it almost entrepreneurship opportunities are there in every industry so there's no such thing as an industry where there's no entrepreneurship opportunity so any human activity there are entrepreneurship opportunities so uh basically unless you understand at least at a certain depth uh a particular field of interest to to you it's hard to really understand what customers are thinking what they're missing in their lives or in their jobs or in their functional in the things that they do and it's difficult for them to for anyone to conceptualize a solution for this so I would say that 5 10 even 10 10 years is probably a good amount of hands-on experience um is would be nice to have now you know some areas um which are at the cutting edge like AI etc uh you know schools are a are a hotbed of en
trepreneurship and the reason it's a hotbed of entrepreneurship in areas like AI etc or or technologydriven or the cutting edge disruptive technologydriven industries is because the industry just doesn't get it doesn't understand when the internet came along industry did not understand what internet was when cloud came along they didn't understand what cloud or blockchain so you know the cutting edge disruptive technologies are good areas for u straight out of college entrepreneurs but uh if you want to develop an industrial product or a consumer product or a consumer service um in any field then you need to know then you need to have understanding of how that industry works how that business works right right and and I would say that 90% plus are startups in those fields not in cutting edge disruptive technology fields right right so um from your experience can you give us an idea of how you identified a problem and uh started one of your companies what what insights did you gain from the industry yeah so basically three companies right so three companies I've been involved with as a founder so the first one was a semiconductor company and I had worked in the semiconductor industry for probably 10 or 12 years and um me and my co-founders three co three engineers we found that you know nobody was doing a chip development in the way we conceptualized it the four of us con conceptualized it and we felt that you know this would be a breakthrough and price performance functionality cost we thought it would be a breakthrough and um you know so we quit our jobs and we started OPI because you know we knew the industry for a dozen years we knew what the big companies like Intel and BLSI and Texas Instruments and others were not doing and as a consequence that that we felt that we could do and uh we quit and then started the company and that became very successful and four or five years we had hundreds of millions of dollars in sales and you know could to take the company public and all these things because we knew the industry we knew the customers We knew the market we knew the technology we knew where the gap was and we rushed into to the gap uh when we came when if I move to selectica there my co-founder was a guru
in artificial intelligence way before anybody else and uh he had a hunch that that this AI technology could be deployed on the internet platform especially with Java coming along in the 1996 time frame so it was just a hunch uh nobody knew if the market would accept it customers would accept it but he felt that you know this thing could become something that people would really benefit from and uh you know uh I teamed up with this AI guru and uh you know we my job was to help him take this technology vision that he had and make it into a product that would generate value that people would be confident to buy getting people to accept this cutting edge technology was my value ad my value ad was how to make something that was palatable right you know to the CIOS of Fortune 500 companies you know because they were all accustomed to doing things with databases and software and things like that and you're saying no we can do use AI in order to do rules and create a rules engine and so on and then uh basically it becomes a more maintainable and uh more reliable system and so on and uh it could be deployed on the internet and you know you sales people can uh uh quickly take orders and things like that so we had to make the pro make the technology into a product that was palatable for the buyer which was the CIO of these big Fortune 500 companies and so essentially you know uh I would say that in the second case it was more a question of great technology but technology by itself nobody buys only when it delivers something valuable of service to them and them saying okay I'll I'm willing to put my business processes on your platform or your techn technology u and give you a chance right to show me how to do that it's so value so so so basically like you know um it's it's a startup happens in many different ways and um sometimes it's technologydriven which becomes a disruptive force and sometimes it is uh just a brilliant new idea that I can do And if you move fast enough and quickly enough you make it happen uh so many many ways um and a good way is if you talk to dozens of customers in any industry you might start seeing a pattern maybe we say you know I would like to have something like this and this guy says "Yeah I w
ould like to have you know a car like Elon Elon Musk saw that you know I would like to have a car which you know doesn't generate so much pollution." And somebody says you know a car that accelerates very fast and and then Elon Musk comes up with his EV car right so 25 years ago so yeah many many different ways but it all boils down to finding something where not you but the customer gets the benefit right it's not about you entrepreneurship is not about you at all and and not about you know you're this it's all about how does it how can you be of service to somebody else right correct correct correct yes yeah so there is this eternal conflict between uh a question whether entrepreneurs are born or entrepreneurs are made can you demystify this based on your experience with entrepreneurship teaching so when you teach entrepreneurship what kind of outcomes do you expect do you expect a shift in mindset do you accept do you expect uh venture creation what kind of outcomes are you do you look at yeah so so you know people have two career paths and traditionally all our teaching all our academia was focused at making us employees which is the idea is the boss's idea the manager tells you what to do and you are the grunt who does the work right so we are taught to be good employees you know who can that's that is what we it doesn't matter which school whether it's IIT or whether whatever it school teaches us to be a good employee follow orders you know and what happened is that about 30 40 maybe 50 years ago in Silicon Valley um we you So ordinary engineers started coming up with ideas and then some investors said hey if you got such a good idea why don't you create a start a company and they started giving stock options to everybody and what ended up happening is that the 20 30 40 years later the top 10 companies in the world are all entrepreneurial startups not a single top 10 company in the world is an old company that you know was that just makes more and more stuff it's like entrepreneurial companies that you know uh disrupt how people live their lives how they spend their time how they entertain themselves how they uh enjoy food how they get medical treatment all entrepreneurial companies and all the richest pe
ople in the world are not the Rockefellers anymore the richest people in the world are people like Elon Musk that nobody had heard of or Bill Gates nobody had heard of or you know so all suddenly like the world changed because of the fact that some engineers came up with bright ideas they met some people who said hey why don't you start a company based on your idea and and now when the disruptive force of entrepreneurship on the wealth of nations the wealth of nations is determined by your entrepreneurial aptitude of your of your workforce you know how many do you have enough people that can do things in a new way use the latest technology to create great services etc and create great companies which will have great value i mean if you just think about it companies like Nvidia and so on in 3 four years have generated market capitalization from 100 billion to3.5 trillion dollars cool that is equal to India's GDP guys right one company and there are hundreds of such companies right so if the wealth of the US or the wealth of China or the wealth of India with all its unicorns etc is coming from entrepreneurs all of a sudden right so so basically you know the whole idea is that that you know when you teach entrepreneurship can we change the mindset so that people don't have even when they have their idea they don't let that idea just die everybody I used to tell in my classes that everybody in his life will get at least five good ideas which are all worth a unicorn But 99.999% never used to do anything about those ideas maybe it's impossible it's too difficult you know I don't think I can do it you know when am I going to raise the money you know all kinds of negative feelings right about because you're trained to be an employee you know you're not trained to you know uh uh do things that uh that that'll that change people's lives you know so based on your on your own drive and uh with entrepreneurship teaching the whole goal is to say that look entrepreneurship is not just for people who are born who are Bill Gates children who've got billions of dollars at their hand most likely they won't even become entrepreneurs it's actually people who don't have any resources are the ones that are going to be the millionaire
s billionaires trillionaires 10 years from now the people who don't have the money and the why because in entrepreneurship it's a question of attracting resources it's not a question of using whatever resources you have so big companies use resources that they have in order to get a job done to get a project done to build a new uh factory or whatever but entrepreneurs when they have the vision of something fantastic people throw money at them so the risk money resource comes engineers give up their jobs at big companies like Reliance and so on and quit to join somebody and uh on and on and on it's like uh somebody was telling me today about uh a company that was started called um uh in in the health industries and u he said that you know this uh entrepreneur came up with the idea and then he convinced or his when he talked about his idea to the CEO of one of the biggest hospitals in the Bay Area Yeah um essentially that guy gave up his job as CEO of the hospital to join him to make this idea into a big company and uh what was the name of the company it's uh uh I'll think of it before we finish this interview but I I I'll give you the name of the company but this company has now raised $110 million and is valued at $6 billion and the company was started in 2023 oh young company yes young company exactly but but you know that's that's what entrepreneurs do uh they basically have this amazing idea about how to do something and um and essentially it attracts you know this the smartest and the best competent you know manager in the health services business it attracts $110 million from different venture capitalists it attracts engineers it attracts AI gurus it attracts everybody and all of a sudden this company two years later is already worth $6 billion obviously they've not gone public but that's the market capitalization of the funding for this company so um yeah I'll send you the name of the company upon right right that's that's magical almost it is it's magical when you when it happens right and it's happening all the time everywhere in the world right now it's not a magic that only happens in Silicon Valley and so on it's happening everywhere and it is the real wealth of a nation to have you know entrepreneur
s who are problem solvers that result in a business being formed so you got to be a if you are problem solver that works in a cor corporate company you're an employee but if you're a problem solver that results in a new company being formed you're an entrepreneur same problem but if you start a company around that problem that you solved you became an entrepreneur and then you know the sky is the limit in terms of your success in terms of your fame in terms of the value in terms of the money that you'll make exactly yes yes so coming back that that was there was so much wealth in just this one answer Raj you know I I'm really absolutely students the perspective that students need to bring to the journey of entrepreneurship and this concept of understanding that you you attract resources by identifying a problem that you can solve rather than dip into existing resources that is so powerful yes yes that is that is the essense of being an employee and entrepreneur same problem all right exactly exactly exactly exactly uh coming to entrepreneurship educators would you focus on the curriculum or the pedagogy for this particular area like obviously you cannot teach entrepreneurship the way we teach maths you know on a board and solve problems you've got to go out there and solve problems so when uh so there are there are multiple questions here one is should an educator look at the curriculum design only or should they bring in pedagogy and what kind of innovation can they bring into their classroom to make students alive to the entire world of entrepreneurship yeah so that's a very good question so I think the curriculum has to be there in my opinion you know they there is such a thing as learning right they have to learn something new and there's enough new things to learn in entrepreneurship and uh the main thing that they are learning is how they can form a company around an idea so there's a whole bunch of skill sets that are needed to build a company around an idea you know you got to know a little bit of finance you know got to know a little bit of product development you got to know about marketing you got to know about sales you got to know about negotiating you got to you know there's a whole bunch that has
to be is something that students are not going to be aware of and not even have a clue and not even have a personality uh you know of high EQ and things like that and how to network and how to uh you know convince people about anything so in my opinion curriculum is a must you know there has to be an organized way that you know we teach them the skills that they will need to build a company around an idea right so how to choose the right idea how to find a how to develop a business model comp uh canvas which will help them choose the right idea to put that uh valuable time behind and so on so all that you know there is no option but through a systematic curriculum um but entrepreneurship you know will never be understood if you don't actually do it the lessons of life come that will help you actually actually create a company comes by doing right so there needs to be some methodology to get students to do things right so uh you know uh for product development very important that the student learns to get their hands dirty to build a proof of concept you know so uh to do experimentation then uh to do the marketing they have to go and do their surveys and customer inquesting and so there needs to be a methodology by which students have to put together uh hands-on experience of what it'll take to understand uh at a very deep level within them you know the needs of a customer or how a product would work or how it would solve a problem or how to communicate it to the customer when you're selling you know how to discuss price how to convince uh investors that you know you have the ability to build this great company so unless you have the hands-on experience that supplement and reinforce the curriculum that they're being taught uh it'll just be an academic exercise right and and you know uh these days with AI tools like Chad GBD they can write a business plan they can write a marketing plan they can write a sales plan they can write everything uh in seconds right but that's not going to make you an entrepreneur they can make you they can build a satellite to the moon using yeah exactly they can there's so much they can do but that won't create a business it won't create a company you know to create a company you nee
d to go at least 10 levels deeper in every element of or every facet of your company right you got to really understand how do I reach this customer base who's my market for my customer for my product you know who's what will stimulate them to actually buy it what so in every area you need to develop your intuitive understanding which Chad GBD will never get because it's an AI tool so it'll that intuitive understanding of your technology of your product of of your technology of your product of your u marketing of your market of your sales uh capability etc all that comes that intuitive understanding only comes through hands-on experience so we've got to mesh the two right yeah so so when we look at entrepreneurship programs in an academic setting you know um it it becomes challenging for students to actually take up this fieldwork or and get into the world outside for customer discovery or problem identification so how can this become more meaningful how a more meaningful experience for students yeah so that that's a problem that you know I've struggled with and we've struggled it with with at IIT for you know years and years and uh other universities like Stanford University the Stanford technology venture program with whom we are very well coupled and who worked with us very closely they also struggle with you know uh helping students get this knowledge and u there's a a lot of uh different approaches that have been put to work and now there's enough uh success sto success uh paths to providing this uh deep understanding so one of the things that uh we did is to go ahead and um have the university or the college actually focus on bringing together the uh industry players to interact with the students so if you remember at IIT we have this uh the biolab right the the bolab and in the bolab they have access to like you know 50 or 100 doctors cardiologist hematologist renologist this every kind of doctor nurse hospital everybody is art and connected with this lab or this this center for biomedical entrepreneurship and betic right and and you know since uh they're connected the students who are interested in doing a biomed startup you know the hard work of doing introductions and providing uh access to people who
understand a problem or understand a need that access is provided So um you know it would be very hard for somebody to a student to have access to a worldass cardiologist or a world class and somebody says you know I think there's some new material that has been discovered which can make the next generation of stances now how if they cannot get access to a cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon how are they going to develop this stent Right even though there is some new material there is some new technology there is some new uh whatever uh science that that uh you know this student has got access has figured out you know or had a vision about or whatever so the in my opinion the university has to do a fair amount of work to decide that we are going to focus our entrepreneurial industry experience for the students who want to get entrepreneurial do entrepreneurial startups in that particular area we are going to do the work of getting them to connect with the ecosystem of that industry right if you remember we did the rural project right right at with IIT Bombay and we took all our students and connected them with the farmers and villagers and the panchiats and the everybody in this advasi village you know near Gujarat in Gujarat and the students would have never connected with these farmers but they came up with 20 brilliant startup ideas right absolutely i remember that but but you know if I through its alumni organization wheels had not done the introduction and the logistics to make that connection happen so my viewpoint is that it's none of this is very impossible thing to do or very expensive it's more a question of uh recognizing that students are not going to have a good set of connections into the industry ecosystem where they are trying to do it even so they might be brilliant electrical engineers but if they don't have access to the lassim tub bro leadership and managers and GE and so on how are they going to come up with any breakthrough idea uh breakthrough products and services for that electrical industry and the same thing with rural or health care or whatever so I think the university has to and the university has the ability to also do it right but to open up access to a particular ecosystem so ho
w do what is the gap that you find in the incubation and institutional uh academic entrepreneurship education systems there are two ecosystems already present in many universities they have incubators they have entrepreneurship teachers they have an EC cell and yet there are some gaps right yeah so I would say that because you know I'm also familiar with all the incubators in the US right and I've seen examples of things like Alchemist Accelerator you know u uh and and other um incubators in Silicon Valley and I've seen obviously incubators like sign and I Bombay etc right and so on and I would say that the main uh the main difference that I see between the ones in Silicon Valley and the ones in India is that the ones in Silicon Valley provide connection with industry experts so besides providing you know the the workbench and the access to internet or whatever it is or cloud or whatever uh and in and a little bit of money etc they provide access to people who are leaders in the industry that the entrepreneur is that that they are supporting so if somebody is you know interested in the let's take an example u uh some crypto industry or whatever you know because he's got some new crypto algorithms or whatever and he gets accepted by Alchemist Accelerator or one of these Silicon Valley X then the incubation center will reach reach out to the top you know kind of business leaders um finance leaders uh marketing and sales people in the crypto industry which might be banking insurance whatever and connect them with this uh crypto entrepreneur and and then when they connect they basically you know there's a uh basically there's a contract where the crypto entrepreneur has to give.1% or.5% of his stock to these industry leaders you know and and so both sides you created a benefit for the industry expert helping this brilliant crypto researcher and the crypto researcher having access to this talent in areas that they obviously don't have so so basically um basically uh I would say that um it's the industry connection with people leadership people in leadership positions that these incubators provide for their budding entrepreneurs and I don't see that kind of uh you know activist approach to making connections and um y
ou know I I think I don't know why but uh as yet I haven't seen that level of of uh activist networking or connections that I that incubate incubation uh incubator does in order to help the future entrepreneur Right and and and I think that's I think the missing gap among everything else okay right that that is that is valuable that's that is so apt the network and and the right the appropriate network that an entrepreneur needs for building his or her unique uh concept absolutely we cannot predict what a young entrepreneur would want uh you know and we need to be ready to be able to facilitate those connections for them facilitating those connections and doing it in an activist way true true active yeah you have to somebody has to actively make the phone call somebody of some person who's influential reputable like the director of IIT calling you know somebody at his uh the CEO of Lass and Tubu and saying you know I would like your director of engineering in this high-powered area to talk to my uh you know that level of desire to help the entrepreneurs succeed needs to be there in an organ organization in in a university absolutely you're that that is that is you hit the nail on the head with that let's let's let's uh look at the student uh point of view so according to the case data we see that 58% of students have mentioned that the main hiccup the main factor influencing their decision to start up is u identified as familiar pleas family pressure how can students navigate through this and experiment with startups as a student well I think you know um in India at least in India that I know of parents sacrifice everything for their students education you know all their life savings etc people invest in their students education whether at IIT or medical school or anywhere else right I mean education India still cost money and for four five years they're they're basically student is spending their parents' hard-earned saved money right so you know I can understand why parents and family would love their children to take a conservative next step forward Because entrepreneurship is a high-risk highreward activity and you know the failure rate of entrepreneurs is significant and uh uh by definition it it's never g
oing to go down that failure rate will stay where it is and uh and the question is but is you know um families are not going to be happy with their student essentially graduating and then turning down an Infosys offer for 50 lakh rupees a year they're just not going to be happy uh and and and basically you know uh try to start a company and need more angel funding from their parents etc so you know it's a realistic problem there's no no two ways around it um and by the way that's true in Silicon Valley also it's like even Silicon Valley parents are not ha if they've spent quart million or half a million dollars to put their students through Stanford or Harvard or Princeton or whatever want them to get a good job at the end of it and not become you know poor entrepreneur uh but uh you know there's a lot more uh there's a lot more safety nets in in in the west compared to a developing economy like India so I I would say that you know um I would say that you know as a professor of entrepreneurship you know we should be happy if if you know maybe just uh I would say 1% of our students one out of 100 students actually you know decides to start a company right off the bat you know um if you're lucky maybe two will start but but you know if if two start it's it's pretty good because we have planted the seed and it's just a matter of you know time when the students are you know reasonably secure financially know something about the industry have network into uh into the team that is going to be needed to p make the idea happen and be rep credible and reputable with investors like venture capitalists and angels etc that you know their company has a fair shot at succeeding so it and so I'm not basically somebody who would push students to start companies right out of school my attitude is if something comes along and it's a brilliant idea and it starts attracting resources great you know uh do start your company because you can feel the magnetic pull that your idea has got and uh then you go for it but if not you know um you've learned everything about entrepreneurship you know how to do it you've got all the skills uh and now you know understand an industry really well become financially reasonably fin stabl
e financially etc so that you have a little bit of runway on your own to build your company you know you can go without a paycheck for a year or so and uh run and create something of value before you know to run create a company successful company which is what I did i you know it took me 17 years before I could pull together the courage to jump and start my first company yeah correct in fact Raj while you were speaking I was thinking this whatever you're saying there are so many gems out there i wish every entrepreneur every student was listening into this today um it's it's like a toolkit for entrepreneurs if I may put it that way you you actually Well I' I've experienced it so and you know Yeah that's the main thing exactly exactly and so so if if I had to ask you for one resource hack one mind shift mindset shift and one personal failure story to close this interview you know u I think there will be so much more and like I said earlier we will come back for some more uh insights from your experience so yeah so mindset mindset shift that you would advise students who face fear of starting up like you said earlier or family pressure let's start with that yeah so my attitude is that you know um entrepreneurs need to develop a eye to understand and be empathetic of what others are facing that's the first skill of an entrepreneur that they have empathetic eyes that's what I say you you can put you can see yourself in the shoes of of a housewife who's struggling with with something or the other or a student who's suffering you know struggling with something or a farmer who's struggling with something you have got to have empathetic eyes you know it can't be you know somebody who just brushes away you know other people's needs uh expectations desires you know you got to be able to put yourself in in their shoes right so and and and really get it so empathetic eyes is what I call you know um is something that an entrepreneur needs to develop which in my opinion we just don't teach our academia academia does not teach us to be empathetic about anything in life you know you can't you're only looking at everything from your own eyes and that's a very selfish way and a selfish per a selfish person can never be an entre
preneur just to be point blank think about uh you know uh about that thing so uh so the first thing is that you know an entrepreneur needs to have the mindset of wanting to be empathetic right caring and uh so on so so that is the mindset shift from me oriented to you oriented kind of mindset empathetic right exactly exactly and then eyes to understand you know oh if this person has a problem then so so many people should have a problem so so many people will buy the product so so much money can be made so so many people can be hired so you know so eyes is what is the vision right it's a vision that that empathy and understanding that that empathy gave will give you a vision of what is possible for your company right and um so that is in my opinion the mindset change for you know any any collegegoing student that we need that's that's number one right so what is the next question one resource hack for student entrepreneurs or or any entrepreneur for that matter because not easy so my as I said you know to succeed as an entrepreneur you got to be somebody who attracts resources you know I said that is how an entrepreneur basically you know makes brings his company to life right because he attracts resources right so so so my viewpoint is that you U how do you make yourself attractive somebody that attracts resources right what is it that'll make you not somebody who repels resources but attracts resources right a lot of uh VC's will run from 90% of the entrepreneurs that go to meet them but then they meet this one entrepreneur and all the VCs want to throw money at him right right what is it how do you go from being somebody who repels VCs to somebody who attracts VCs right right uh how same thing with how do you attract customers versus repelling customers the guy says I'm so busy don't try to sell me another toothbrush or toothpaste or whatever and and then Baba Ramdev comes along and all of a sudden everybody wants his ayurveic toothpaste right so so the point is that uh you know how do we go ahead and change a personality from being a repeller to somebody who attracts and to me you know people who attract are people who are not all about themselves okay so it comes that kind of empathy it comes back to empat
hy and then developing the personality correct correct that you are not about yourself right it's it's like somebody who's you know goes ahead and um and does a major project within within uh uh at UN at the campus or whatever uh you know runs E cell or something like that you know these are all developing the personality of attracting uh resources and attracting and being of interest to people rather than somebody who just you know pushes away the very people that they're going to need if they're ever going to succeed right so so in my opinion it is university is a great place to uh learn the skills that will make you an attractive human being right so that that is what students need to if they learn anything in in universities they got to learn how to be attractive to all the resources they're going to need who are going to help them succeed in life right so so that is what uh and that means you know good communication skills u uh basically being disciplined uh being on time you know following up with uh with people when you know you've made any commitments keeping your commitments there's a whole bunch of personality traits that need to be developed if you're going to become an a person who attracts resources versus somebody who repels resources right right right yeah like who wants to work with who wants to work with somebody that comes late to a meeting or comes unprepared to a meeting or who comes you know uh you know just doesn't you know uh have everything done in a nice proper way you know you know with a nice little well well digested you know how to put put together a package of collateral properly and so on so basically you know you have to develop the skills to uh and and traits and personality traits that'll make you attractive to you know the resources that you want because if you have these traits you know things will just start happening for you and that's what we want right right one one story of failure from where you took lessons and uh what what what how how do you how would you advise an entrepreneur to separate their failure uh the failure of a startup from personal failure yeah so basically like you know an entrepreneur's life is all about failures every every day uh there are failures y
ou you lost this uh sales opportunity your your product did not work as well uh you lost this engineer that you wanted that you could that decided not to join your company i mean an entrepreneur faces failures every day forget one failure and you know an entrepreneur that loses their optimism is the real failure yes the the person that is not so confident and positive and optimistic and you know uh and and you know gives in to you know the set daily setbacks is the biggest failure and and and you know to me that is probably the number one most important important thing that uh entrepreneur needs to learn about failure which is every failure is actually just a step or of learning it's a learning step it's not anything about you being bad or whatever uh you being a disappointment it's all about hey that's an important lesson that I learned today about you know this person did not join my company but the next person that I interview I'll be to convince him to join my company or this customer didn't buy my product this is why he decided not to buy my product next time I will make him buy it this way or you know this VC did not invest my money I'm going to have to change my messaging or my product positioning or my or my or the way I've written my deck or or or you know how I pitch or you know it's a learning opportunity so basically there's no such thing as failure it's actually more a question of you know how many how can you stay in learning mode through the journey of entrepreneurship that's what it's all about so the magic word here is next like exactly what what what next so all right this didn't work what next what next what next and you know what do I need to do to self-improvement correct interesting yeah you have to improve you have to make it better you can't you know you can't just use the same idea it failed it failed it failed it failed it failed you know you have to keep changing your PPT deck with every VC you got to change the way you answer questions you got to change the way you approach the VC you the you know you to keep evolving and becoming becoming you know better and better at every task that has to be done till you become unbeatable right you see no choice but to invest in your company yeah
and all the time you keep your ear to the market demand market needs customer experience totally totally yeah you have to okay so just one last question because you were talking about VCs attracting funds versus repelling uh VCs one of the talks that came up Shark Tank uh and programs like this have really grown in popularity and today students think that success is equal to fundraising through a VC can you yes just if you could well I would say that you know less than.1% of entrepreneurs successfully get VC funding It's minuscule it's virtually 99% of entrepreneurs essentially bootstrap angel fund organically uh fund customer funds you know that is the way 99% of startups happen and we see come in much later when there is much more you know what we used to call you know product market fit you know once the product market fit happens then you know professional money's etc will see the light of your vision and you know want to invest in your company right but there needs to be enough validation of the product market fit which you know uh is hard work that has to be done and it has to be funded one way or the other through bootstrapping angel funding paying customer funding etc right so uh my viewpoint is that u you know u there's a time for VC funding and the VC funding should be attempted only after you have a good validatable product market fit if till you have that you're just wasting your time in my opinion because the chance of getting VC funding is so low that that's not where it's worth spending your time spend your time on the product market fit absolutely so yes and uh I want to close this interview with one last question um what's one bold prediction that you would make about India's startup ecosystem by 2030 particularly student startup ecosystem well I I think you know um you see the world is moving to a very uh knowledged driven or uh knowledge knowledge driven and AIdriven kind of u future you know the world is uh changing very rapidly and all our students are going to live in a world that is so different than what we thought that you know we lived through a very tumultuous 40 50 years after graduating but our students are going to have even a much more tumultuous life because you know it's going
to be a world of robots humanoid drones uh AI And uh all kinds of intelligent uh agents and uh uh um basically where everything around you is doing and delivering things that you know uh that disrupt you know anything any concept of a steady job that you know you could have for 40 years that concept itself is is is now becoming totally obsolete that I can be a CA for 40 years or I can be a doctor for 40 years or I can be a nurse for 40 years because you thought you could be a nurse for 40 years but then suddenly you know all the things that you were doing is done by a humanoid robot who will do it 24 hours a day for onetenth amount of money without making a single mistake take and so on uh and the same thing for doctors same thing for for CAS etc right so so the thing is that you know no industry is safe but you know India with its focus on education being so fundamental to the futures of our students etc um these educated students from India are the ones who are going to actually make this future that is so scary for everybody happen so so that is so basically in my opinion you know India has to do whatever is necessary in order to see this vision where India is the change agent right for the new world that is going to emerge whether whether we we we want it or not right so we have to become the people that embrace the future the new world that is going to be on us within 5 10 15 years and uh and and and and be the drivers and uh our education system our mindset of our students everything that we talked of today in terms of being empathetic eyes in terms of driven uh to uh help rather than to uh want to get something you know it's like all these things are going to be fundamental traits of what Indians are capable of in terms of helping change and make the future happen absolutely in fact a Swedish entrepreneur was saying that India would lead the change for the world into the next uh Yeah because India is just got the intelligence here and the awareness as to and our leadership from Prime Minister Modi down is there to go ahead and u make this uh vision of India driving the futures future of the world right to happen yeah wonderful so that's such a positive note for students to know that they are going to be
driving the change and we look at the world wanting to come to India and lining up for Indian visas and passports awesome okay wonderful aerna Dr aerna thank you very much thank you so much uh Raj this was a wealth of learning for educators as well as students and I'm really looking forward to some more uh work on this and I look forward to being in touch with you for this yes thank you so much yeah thank you for this opportunity you know I think we I think brought a lot of important ideas together right and that and that's what this conversation is all about you know the it's it's what it's the brilliance is in the dialectic between our conversation rather than you know your knowledge or my knowledge independently right exactly exactly and and I think um we should work on that toolkit from you okay so let's talk about it sometime great absolutely okay
