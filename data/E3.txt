NEW YOUTUBE SOURCE: Excerpts from the transcript of the video "Did Lucky get Lucky? | ft. Lucky and Dr. Puran Singh | IIT Mandi | Special Ep.1 SES-3 | GUESSS India" uploaded on the YouTube channel "GUESSS India"
my name is Puran Singh and I'm bringing to you student entrepreneurship stories i have with me Lucky who is a student of IMBA program at I Mandi i met him last year and he has recently completed one year uh the first year of this program and recently during the semester break he started a venture which is what intrigued me and uh I've invited Lucky to uh talk to us about why would he do such a crazy thing one year into um undergraduation program right first year right after plus two so I mandi he's from Hana and we see that by by the time the semester closes lucky announced venture which he calls IMBA beacon and we were intrigued uh the faculty group at I Monday we were intrigued saying what happening what is lucky doing and then over the next month or so we saw him do a lot of things which were interesting and I thought let Let's talk to Lucky and ask him more about why did he start this little venture lucky this is your first venture let's call this first venture okay so welcome Lucky to this interaction please tell us about what is IMBA beacon first of all and then I'll ask you the question why I do such a crazy thing go ahead so first of all thank you so much for the opportunity so IMBA beacon is a initiative that I took to mentor students who are aspiring to join IMBA program at IIT Mandi so at IMBA beacon me along with four or five batchmates we just guide students how they can ace the interview strategies and tips so that they can uh drive interview in their favor and things like that and one important thing that I missed out is we are also spreading awareness about this program many students didn't know this okay this type of thing also exists and now they knew it and I hope they okay and we also recently concluded the interview round for this but I want to know is when you started this IMBA weekend okay uh initially I confused it with maybe this is an initiative that we have taken and I'm aware of it as a school that we started some IMBA beacon to tell students uh about you to help them prepare and then I realized uh and you reached out to me as well sir I want to discuss about IV week and I thought maybe you have been deployed by or appointed by the admissions committee to spread awareness and when we
had an interaction I figured out no this this is a this is a startup this is a small startup project that you're trying to do u so where did this begin uh when did you get the idea idea and what was that uh context where you thought I could do this so let us start from the very start so until my 12th class I was very much involved in sports from past six seven years so I'm a three times national medalist in fencing and by mid 12th I realized that okay if I put this hard work in studies I'll get more output maybe in terms of money and time freedom and all that so I just shifted my career then I got interested into NDA and I gave the exam qualified the written exam all the times and in total I gave four attempts two before getting into IIT Mundi and two after getting into IIT Mundi so I cleared the written exam cleared the stage one but couldn't clear the stage two that is the conference round so then I decided okay uh let me look for alternatives as my J was J score was also not very high so I looked for alternatives as I was not really interested into BTE but then I started looking for opportunities then IP and it was really interesting and as I got to know about IPMAT I also got to know about IIT Mundy's integrated MBA and this was even more interesting technology and management so I applied for it and I got in and then too I was thinking okay after a semester or so I'll just leave the institute and join national defense academy but all is in front of you so I didn't get selected and I didn't even appear for my last attempt because this business thing was more interesting to me now and I started to look for opportunities and I was so much interested in entrepreneurship okay I want to start my own venture and all then I saw this opportunity okay although this is not a full-time and so-called big venture but I just took it as a small project so that I have an entrepreneurship experience how to build team how to lead people how to deal with customers marketing strategies and all that stuff so I got to know so many things that will for sure help me if I start another venture that is full-time and I'm actively looking for that so that is it i saw the opportunity and I just picked it up so let us tell u uh the view
ers about the venture a little bit more so far we've only called it IMBA beacon and we've said you know you are spreading awareness or you're guiding let's talk more in business terminology who is a customer is someone who appeared for J this year and is looking for colleges okay what is the problem that they have problem is they are mostly going in PCM they don't know what are the alternatives and different opportunities after 12 okay what is the problem that you are solving for them first thing is awareness second one is guiding through the interview process okay and uh uh what what is it that you offer this uh service to them what what is the modality what is the that you offer okay so initially we started with just one pack that is for 1,500 rupees and in that pack we have three mock interviews with detailed feedback and all and along with that based on the previous year interview patterns we had some important questions okay these are some questions that are repeatedly asking asked by almost everyone so we made some small exercises out of that okay so why imba is an important question so read the brochure carefully because you'll get so many terminologies and ideas to frame your answer why imba because there are so many features out there written on the brochure so if you go through the brochure then it will be very helpful to frame this answer so exercises like these we had four or five exercises and we had these mock interviews along with that if someone is facing some issues with answer framing and if someone is not able to guide their interview in their favor so we just tell them okay use only those words and things that you are aware of and that you can explain everything so things like that we offered initially but as uh it was a last time I mean just a one week before the interviews we offered two more packs in that we didn't had any exercises and all we just had 600 for one mock interview and 1,000 for two mock interviews okay uh you're looking at people who are applying for any program or only the IMB program since you call it IMB vehicle our uh main problem solving is guiding students who are applying for it but also there are many students who are not aware of this so we are spreading awareness
and the students who are getting aware we are taking them into IMBA and so that they purchase our course right so my next question is uh if we uh go back in time when when is it you did explain that uh interest in NDA of you were you know you played nationals uh in fencing u but um all of that motivate you how did that motivate you to become an entrepreneur or try an entrepreneurial venture what was the trigger exactly how does this background in sporting and interest in NDA uh did that lead you to this or because that didn't happen you got interested in business or that wasn't happening you picked this so what exactly happened it was you can say a mix of both of them it was not happening and I was a little interested in this because I have developed so many skills like leading team uh and working with people collaboration as a fencing was also a team game along with individual games so yes I learned so many things and those things also helped me in this venture and also things were not happening so I looked for alternatives and I found this more interesting and as as far as IMB is concerned at what time did it hit you that you could do this venture in the last one year you may have gone through the courses in school of management here and would have uh been introduced to business but um at what point did you think that I will do this project this startup okay so it was during our mids in second semester it was uh February last week I guess so me and Yupta were sitting in library and I just told Yukta okay hey uh can't we do this then she said okay it's a great idea we can start working on that and as uh I proceed with it so Yukta was like okay I can't do this uh uh maybe some personal reasons but uh then I started alone and recorded my first video with the help of my roommate and Yukta but she was not really into this initially we decided a 50/50 but now I was just alone she was just helping me in recording videos and all but later on she joined me back as a mentor for mock interviews that is a different story but yes initially we started as two then she got out i was alone when we actually actually started and actually working on it but we discussed the idea at the same time in Jul uh February February and Fe
bruary tell us more about this video why what is this video business you had to record the video okay so most of the JS parents use YouTube as for watching videos and with YouTube we started on Instagram and now we are also on LinkedIn so if some professionals kid is also appearing for J so they can also look in for their daughters and so initially we started with YouTube and Instagram because most of the youth is on Instagram and many students are using YouTube so for spreading awareness about the course in first video we didn't mention anything about our mentorship course we just told okay hey this is IMBA beacon oh I mean this is IMBA at IIT Mundi if you are not aware of this okay have a look in this okay so that's why the videos uh were were required okay great but didn't you think that you know you're just a student and you are just completing your second semester first year into the program at IIT Maldi uh starting a venture of you know asking people to pay you did it not sound crazy to you why would they come to you it was and initially before starting when the idea was in ideation stage so I was like okay I'll get so many registration I'll get six figures and all that stuff but when I actually started it I got only one registration in first 15 days 10 15 days so I was like okay I didn't expect that but as soon as the dates approached and I worked hard on marketing and spreading awareness then we grew very fast and there were some days in which we had 8 9,000 revenue per day but initially there were 10 15 days when we had zero revenue and I was like okay I just got one aspirant and that too his uh like he didn't get more than 75% marks in board exams so I had to refund his money so So it was really heartbreaking okay so uh let's uh drill down a little bit more you said Feb okay i'm writing down here on my piece of paper feb 2025 you get this idea during midsams okay and then you said you had to record videos you started recording videos so tell us a little bit more about uh what is what what are the steps that you followed uh you mentioned several words you said 1,500 rupees you said uh JES parents you said video record awareness let's talk step by step if if any student has to start u you know small min
i startup project startup idea uh what are the first few steps so with your example I want to say what did you what did you do first you recorded a YouTube video then how did you decide you of course said that it should be on YouTube because people watch YouTube but then what content to put how to advertise so let's go step by step so that you know other students who are listening in they can get an idea of how can you build a mini startup uh in the first place so first of all look for an opportunity there was a huge opportunity that was lying and I explored it and get into this so I'll explain it in my case so I thought okay we can do I can do this and this so for that first thing is awareness because I was also not aware of this program but I saw a video on YouTube from some random coaching so if someone who is studying in the program he tells about the program it's even more reliable so in first video we didn't market anything see if you are marketing anything in your first video itself they'll be like okay so initially in the first video it was just for information and from the second video onwards we started talking about our mentorship course that two in the end of the video so first thing is information the second thing is grabbing their attention okay so if you want to get an edge over others because we told okay we are offering this and this nobody else in the market is offering this we had a unique thing that is the data data of the last year's student so I personally sat with almost all of my batchmates and asked questions okay what were what were some questions that were asked by you and where do you think you lagged where do you think you performed really well so we had some patterns okay this is where students are stuck or this is how you can drive interview in your favor okay and these are some most important questions that are really asked in the interview repeatedly so then we found the pattern the data that is our USP see there was one one competitor and he started one year back although there were some trust issues with some students okay you you you don't have any experience for taking interviews how do how can we trust you and pay 1,500 rupees and 1,500 rupees was just taken as a reference
because last year as I'm talking about the competitor he put the price as 1,500 and we just wanted to start with the base year as it is our first year so we just tried to put it kind of equivalent but this year he changed a strategy and he just gave two packages one for,000 and one for 1500 and we just started with 1500 and later on we shifted to 600 and 1,000 packs too so initially we started uh for a base 1500 and next year we let's see what happens and what is good to go so you said you start with uh identifying an opportunity and uh because you had faced this process and you had access to your fellow batchmates you could also collect the data on was asked in the interview and therefore you could pitch this as your USB okay but operationally did you have a piece of paper on which you do did some number crunchy wrote your strategy what channels to use date by date plan did you do any of that or was it all let's see what what to do tomorrow no actually if you're asking about numbers uh I didn't get to your question can you please how did you strategize this did you write a plan on the piece of paper tomorrow we going to do this and then day after tomorrow this is the task to be done or you know we will take it as it comes every day we will see what do we have to do so how did you strategize not actually on a piece of paper but mostly I use my phone and there is the option to send message to ourself so I just send any important uh ideas questions that I need to look on or think upon so all the important stuffs I just put it there send a message to myself on WhatsApp and I did it all there because I don't really have a piece of paper every time but ideas are every time everywhere so okay all right and you did mention you know the USP because you were a student here you said the first fellow batchmate backed out and then joined later again how hard was it to convince other people you had five people with you uh initially you were just two of you or did the others did not want to join uh so how hard was it to find people to work with you okay so actually I just approached them to no I didn't even approach they told me okay hey I want to join if you want I can help you with this and all but at that point in time it
was very organized everything was very clear we started getting registrations then only they approached okay hey we can help you with this so there was no as the challenges because everything was well established I just needed some people who can help me because I can't handle so many interviews and all that alone and also we did one more thing that okay there were three mock interviews so we gave three mock interviews with three different panelists and I was common in all the panels and the other person was changing so that students have more exposure to different type of questions interview environment and all okay okay great so um lucky my next question is about uh the mindset of students as a student um starting seems like too too difficult a task did you think you were starting a venture did you think it's an experiment did you think you are going to become an entrepreneur so what exactly did you believe would happen after this project did you think about that so my mindset before starting this was okay this is kind of a entrepreneurship journey only so in a long run I am definitely looking for a full-time venture and for that it will be a good hands-on experience and that is how I started like I want to do a full-time venture and for that it will be a good experience because obviously this is a seasonal business one time in a year so there are some limitations in this I can't really just get into this thing so I'm just looking for a full-time venture and this is a very good experience so many learnings for starting that one yesterday I was talking to a bunch of students about uh starting up and um some some of the questions that they have is sir I'm just a how can I start a company right so did you think of starting a company did did you think that oh startup means I have to register a private limited company and uh then I can start this not one thing I checked out was okay if uh I am doing some legal thing because I saw okay when do I need to pay tax then I found out okay if my annual revenue is more than 2.5 lakhs then I have to uh give tax okay then I was like okay it's fine now that thing I said but yes uh I saw many people on internet who are saying okay I'll do an MBA then I'll do two years of job
so that I have uh recovered the payment that I did to the college for MBA and then I'll start my venture okay there will not be any golden day okay after two years jadu mantra and I have idea okay I'll start my venture now so when you you have ideas now you can start now while waiting for an MBA for 2 years and then two years to recover that payment of loan so it is a good idea to start as soon as you have ideas but then uh you started after the semester break or during this seme because you have courses to take care of you have to study for exams you may be engaged in other co-curricular activities or other administrative club level responsibilities doing a startup would you know how much time do you think a mini startup would take like you did and can you really do it parallelly with your studies was hard because uh in the last 1 month especially we had more than 6 to 8 hours classes almost every day and taking time out even when NSMs are approaching it was really difficult my brother was saying okay hey don't upload the second video first one is done do whatever you have the people now but I was like okay this is the peak time if I'll not do now it will be really difficult to uh catch up with the audience later so I just talked to him and I secretly recorded video and he got to know about it when I uploaded that video and he scolded me okay you didn't focus on your studies and all why you wasting I don't want this IMBA beacon I just want you to study you can start these ventures later on but I like okay I'll manage all the things so so do you think u yeah let's talk about uh brother your brother your family parents friends how did they react to it your brother of course wanted you to uh study and focus on what were some other people in your close circle like parents uh siblings other relatives who knew about this and how did they so my father is in CRPF actually so he don't have much idea about all this but he knew okay I'm just teaching some students and all that and he knows that okay CGPA is important but my CGPA is not really good as of now so he just focus in his studies don't give too much time on that and your main focus should be your college and exams and CGPA and all that okay yeah yes and my mom d
idn't really react okay she says okay do whatever you want and a similar idea okay focus on your exams It must not be ruined because of all this so that you regret later and you are not able to catch up and yes one of my one of my cousins who is a master's graduate from triple triple it Bangalore he told me okay you're doing great and just stick with it okay so not everyone is in in support and when you come to uh an educational program u typically initial mindset is that I have to get a job and then trying to start a venture can actually go crazy right so what kind of support would you expect would you expect your parents or your relatives to be more supportive of you in future or do you think they won't change and you just have to go your you how how are you calibrating that in your mind no what I believe is when money comes they always become supportive as soon as my exams were over and I started getting money although I didn't tell them the complete amount that I earned from this all but I told okay hey mom I just earned 4,000 today today or I just earned 7,000 today so she was like okay good when money comes nobody is like everybody is with you okay but it can so this was a different kind of startup project you got the money you didn't require an initial investment but then there can be uh startup initiatives where you need to invest from your pocket you may need to be borrow steal whatever right in the beginning uh with hardware based startups where you have to build a product Uh so in such cases it could be difficult how do you think if you have to you still have to figure out a long startup idea uh you have made some money and if you want you can share with the viewers how much is that maybe other students will feel inspired and make uh you know this much amount of money in about a month in a short mini startup project but I'm saying if you have to do another project which requires investment money uh how do you think you're going to handle handle that okay firstly I work on a startup which I'm 100% or at least 98 99% on confident on the startup and and looking to the investment also so I'm looking for a venture in which there is not so much of investment like in this one I initially before I started ea
rning I just paid my editor nothing else so it was kind of small investment that I can take out from my pocket money too so initial investment should be low and the returns should be high i'm looking for that one and even if it's the case that we need high investment so we obviously pitch our ideas and if it is like idea we'll definitely get investors uh another question that students have is you know early in the first year you haven't learned a lot of technology right and usually startups are technology based uh and this idea that you uh have experimented with this again does not involve a lot of you know technology there's no product as such but it's it's a service that you're providing to them so did at any point in time you feel like you know it's not going to be a very attractive uh you know startup if I have to tell someone it's just coaching people for interviews so it won't look as uh interesting or as uh you know it's not an AI venture which is the uh thing of the dayto-day right so did you think about these it was never like I want to impress people okay hey I am startup founder and all I just wanted to do it firstly for the experience as a startup owner and secondly for money so it was never about okay impressing people hey I am a starter founder and all it was about me it was about and the learnings that are more important okay at least for for this startup so tell us the outcome and then tell us the learnings what is the outcome u I'm asking the question again tell us give us some of how much money have you made I'm not really comfortable sharing this so let's skip this question all right a mystery okay so coming to learnings firstly is marketing and especially the social media marketing through various channels like LinkedIn YouTube Instagram and we also had a community of more than 135 members on Telegram so where they discuss their doubts and all that stuff so firstly it's it's the marketing secondly handling the audience or our customers in a peak time I received more than 15 20 calls every day for queries about our course and from students who are already enrolled but they have doubts and all like it was a really hectic schedule and I was actually enjoying it i was not like yeah I'm working 1
0 hours a day what the hell is this but I was actually enjoying working 14 15 hours every day for that duration of 8 10 days that was the peak time for a startup so it was really worth investing my time and obviously I was also getting money that was a second thing but I was actually enjoying what I was doing so this is one more thing as I discussed with you previously why are we all doing this why are we earning money so it was just for fun whatever we are doing are we really interested in that so yes I was very interesting and I was enjoying it all and the third thing was is uh building a team and working with them so we had conflicts in our team okay the there was a x amount that I was paying to our mentors per interview it like it is very less so we had so many discussions and we just concluded on the decided amount this year but obviously I'll have to increase it significantly next year okay okay so a lot of learnings and money is uh what is the outcome uh and we'll keep the viewers guessing as to how much amount but I based on our previous discussions it's it's to uh you know take a nice vacation in Himatel and outside which was your plan which you told me earlier okay great uh what were some some areas or you know some days when you felt like oh I failed here this this just did not work can you recall any such moments initially when we started and we were not getting registrations for the first 15 20 days so it was like very heartbreaking i was expecting okay I'll get so many registration I'll earn lacks of rupees and all that stuff but I just got one registration and that too I had to refund the amount so I was like okay will I even get five registrations will it work or I have started this but people are not joining is it really worth spending my time on this and all that stuff but I thought of this okay the registrations for IM are not even open why will people register for my course from now itself it is a long journey so I just waited for the right time and on the peak time we just hit and we got so many registrations okay can you also you know when you have to make decisions as an entrepreneur be it u uh around the pricing be it around which channels should I use uh or what strategy to use what wer
e some interesting decision points that I have to decide this and based on this decision the course this startup is going to change right can you what were you know maybe one or two favorite moments which you maybe enjoyed you were really scared or you were very confident whatever are the highlights for you okay so for registrations when I didn't had any idea okay how websites are made and all that so I just talked to one of my friends okay hey can you make a website for me he said okay if we are register registering it or buying the website name or all that stuff we'll need some money and all that but then I said okay I don't think we'll get so many registrations that we need a website for it so I just tried Google form and that was the first time in life when I made my first Google form for my startup and it was really impressive considering it was the first time so for registrations we kept it on the Google form and at some point in time our registrations were almost zero in the end I'm talking about so I decided to launch two new plans that was 600 for one mock interview and 1,000 for two mock interviews for last minute and that was a successful one we earned thousands of rupees because of that only so at some point in time our revenue was just stagnant and then I introduced a new thing and it went up again so continuous innovation you had to do yeah how did you uh how did you celebrate when you had so many registrations you know maybe there was one day where you got so many registrations and you were like "Okay this is going in my bank account you're happy." How did you celebrate did you call a friend did you uh celebrate with your team members uh did you pray to God or what did you do how did you acknowledge that yeah things are working out okay so generally I just talked to my brother and my cousin who I just previously mentioned from triple it Bangalore so most of the things are discussed with these two so yeah I just told them okay I got this many registrations we hit this much revenue and I'm very happy so many learnings and all that they were like okay good you are doing great did they ask for a sh did they ask you for a party not really but yes we can have it anytime it's not an issue okay so u anot
her question which I wanted to ask earlier was you said after you came to this program in the first year you got introduced to the business world you got introduced you know through the courses in management and business can you again pick some highlights from these courses try to recall where is it where you know in in the class some moments where in a subject something was being taught and helped you shape uh that gave you more confidence that yeah let me try entrepreneurship I want to do this do you have any such moments when your thinking got for entrepreneurships no but in the process yes I would like to highlight written and verbal communication course so I had to write emails and for verbal communication it's the content creation so it helped me in the written part mostly because I was not very confident obviously I use chat GPD but it gave me uh more little more confidence in framing those things and giving prompt to chat GPD and improvising it so I also tried uh this influencer marketing but it was really out of our budget at that point in time so we skipped it i just cold mailed uh almost 15 16 influencers who have their audience as Jes parents i got reply from 78 of them and we talked on call and things really didn't work out we were planning for an affiliate based thing but they were like okay we want some fixed amount we will not work on affiliate basis so we just skipped that part let's build our brand okay but um uh again u that question same question back in the courses you said nothing but during the process uh is when you had this feeling that you you want to do this right okay because in uh initial two semesters there was no such course related to entrepreneurship there was a course that helped me in this is foundations in business management and the second one is problem solving and decision making so these two were some management courses that I found some things really helped me in the process okay okay and over the last one year what skills you know compare yourself to you back what skills have you developed and which skills have helped you build this venture so that you know other students who are uh do this can also sort of pick some of those skills and start working towards that i thin
k so there is not any so-called skill that I have learned through any online channel or anywhere it it was just a part of the process and I can't concretely mentioned okay I learned this skill that skill but there were some things like leadership and all which I learned through sports as in college too I'm part of the basketball team so yes teamwork leadership and all that stuff from there and critical thinking analysis and all that from some courses that I mentioned problem solving and decision- making so yeah it was a mix of so many things until I would say uh the end of my first semester i was like I have to leave this college and all that but then I am at Praguya and things really take a turn so it was a life-changing moment can say for college actually I was just okay playing video games and not even studying for an hour just studying 2 hours before the exam and all that stuff just having fun okay I have to leave this college what's the point of getting good grades in exam and all that stuff but when I meet him uh I realized that okay if I proceed with this thing this minds set and these actions things are not really be going great so I just told him this okay this is what I'm doing this is what the problem I'm facing and this is what I want to do so then we had a long discussion multiple discussions and he initially he gave me some task okay update me every day whenever you're done with this and this and all that stuff then things came back on track and I really really worked hard on my communication skills i uploaded a YouTube video or YouTube short every day for more than 110 straight days consistently not even a single day missing and that really really helped me in improving my communication skills great great thanks i think that's that's quite inspiring 110 days uh day on day recording yourself and putting content on the YouTube not to show to others but you're saying only for yourself to practice that's great so I think uh yeah that's an interesting idea uh you need to have people around you a support system uh whom you go to when you are in trouble or you need guidance uh were there some other people other than Pak uh who where you bounced off your ideas or you spoke to you know some other family m
ember of course we've had some discussions uh as well just went to you sometimes uh in last few days but uh no such mentor he's the only one with whom I discuss my ideas apart from my family okay great great so thanks so much for giving all these details I think uh some ideas which stand out uh especially for the students who are thinking of start thinking hey I need to stumble upon a big idea you don't have to wait you can start you can you know work with the first idea build your first I have this theory of third venture where I believe the students need to reach their third venture which is where uh the real juice lies so I'm I'm so happy that you have done your first venture uh in this imba beacon initiative that we took u secondly student mostly they believe that they don't have the money they don't have the resources so how can the startup they don't have the credibility so it's it's all mindset if you change it a little bit you will find a USB uh now what lucky did was I went through this process so I know what questions are asked and I you know 40 other students uh who got who have gone through the same process so he goes to them and collects the question bank and there you go you have a real asset which is worth selling right and then you are you are part of this program already you've gone through this process so you have the credibility so like that everyone just needs to wants to start something they should just think about what is it you know who they are and what do they know and based on that you know a business proposition uh can be created and starting small is is very important for students especially uh it will be difficult with the studies with the exams and other things and of course the support from families friends starting up is now gradually becoming uh you know a common word part of the jargon and even in the households or rural it is becoming a you know word which is more popular uh but having support from all these people um around you your your support system important it doesn't come automatically but when they see the success uh when they see that you are moving you're taking action then they will support you so action is most important and lucky had a short time window to execute
this idea u there was only about a month within which the interviews were held and he had to get people on board and honestly I was skeptical in the beginning thinking how are you going to get people how will you reach out to them um and I'm having discussions on which channel LinkedIn versus Instagram versus YouTube how will you find those people uh we can of course not share with you the details of applicants how will you uh catch them but I'm glad that you did u I think you had about 30 people 40 people who registered with you which which a great uh lucky does not want to disclose at all okay but these are great insights for any student who is watching and who start the the idea is to start quick take action and seize the opportunity don't wait for a big idea to come your way don't uh for an innovative tech based AI enabled idea just start with what you can do right now and that will give you so much confidence and learning and support from around your ecosystem and help you develop into a very different kind of person who thinks entrepreneurally all of those contribute to you becoming a better person every day right lucky thank you so much for helping us derive all these learnings and I'm sure you will inspire many other students from IIT Mundi and around the country to start up quick start up small and start up fast thank you thank you so much sir and you all can reach me out anytime i'm always up for ideas to discuss new ideas explore new ideas so yes all the best thank you Lucky
