hello everyone and welcome to the guest India cloud experts and entrepreneurs dialogue series i am Dr apan Naro and on behalf of guest India I am talking to you about yet another entrepreneur a young entrepreneur somebody who started up as a student so today we navigate with Prashant Darat the various questions at the heart of student entrepreneurship let me introduce Prashant to you our guest for today prashant was formally um I mean Prashant started off as a student at IIT Bombay and uh took all the courses from the first batch of the Desaieti school of entrepreneurship and from then I have seen Prashant very closely constantly in entrepreneurial mode if I may call it so um and because I've had this opportunity to witness his journey so closely I thought uh we should explore what went on when Prashant started up so welcome Prashant thank you so much for joining us today thanks for having me ma'am yes I'm glad to be part of this series fantastic thank you so much so Prashant uh I know you were a former co-founder of a robotics company and then a co-founder of Adapt Ideations which was a futuristic IoT devices company you worked very closely during COVID for um this project um and you are now on to yet another exciting journey so talk to us about the about your journey first and then we'll take it from there yes so uh thank you once again ma'am i'm glad to be part of this series i started as a a student entrepreneur but let's not call it a student entrepreneur i'm glad that I gave the opportunity to do two electives out of the department so I said uh which which are these two courses that I would do and get away easily that's how it started uh for me but then what has happened is as I started exploring into the entrepreneurship with these courses the first one being uh technology venture creation right so we are only this side of technology and then venture creation has given it it's kind of a simulation on how the venture can scale in in the sheets I think um professors did a really wonderful job including you ma'am in that course uh back in 2015 16 so that's where it started what what it gave is it doesn't stop at technology but there is more to it to convert it as an enterprise and uh that was the triggering
point that okay let's take this as serious uh thing rather than going for conventional placements and all and uh that's where the journey has begun so I um along with um a senior u immediate senior from IIT Bombay and with a batchmate we started um a robotics company and initially to solve the problem of uh uh IED devices inside the land inside in light affected areas in the country that's how it started so how do we scan the area and say that you know this area is out of this out of danger and it is good to explore for our CRPF and Javans that's how it started and uh we um I Bombay uh center for entrepreneurship and um all of all of these entities helped us with initially the fund office and all of that uh to build this robot that can crawl that that navigates um yeah so what has happened is while doing that journey and the help helped us to build a proof of concept then the CRPF was interested so what uh what has happened is we the the cycles that we were going and building was too quick to build it as a scalable product and hence we said okay let's uh then I said you know this is not the mindset we would build a company with then I said okay uh to my other co-founders that you know I would want to leave and start something where uh where we can sell the product quickly because robot is it had it was it was a big platform a moving platform then 6 do robotic arm so they said I came out uh then partnered with uh one more uh um um batchmate uh to form this company called adapt ideations um to solve the problem of uh wastages happening in gold chain logistics and pharma industry so and this this wastage is not only in pharma but this wastage is in the food sector also everything started with the problem statement that about onethird of uh pharma that is produced and uh 1/4 of food that is produced gets wasted simply thrown out the reason being uh these the food that is stored uh is not monitored right there is no alerts that says that hey the food is stored here and nobody it's not put in right temperature right conditions and as as a result the food gets get wasted in couple of hours of time so and in pharma you cannot put vaccine um outside uh temperature ranges for not more than an hour and the efficacy is si
mply low you'll feel that the vaccine got administered but there are no effects to it because vaccine in itself is a microorganism out there and it would die at other temperature so um that was the problem statement we uh worked with um uh ma'am is that fine i'm going little in detail no no no this is this is completely about this no problem please continue yeah yeah so the problems that was the problem statement then we started working on a solution and we said okay there should be an IoT connected device uh that would monitor the stationary uh cold rooms then monitor the vaccine in transit then monitor vaccine in distribution and everything and then all of this would send data to the cloud we would build an intelligent layer uh in the cloud and it would send notifications alerts and many a times pre-alert saying that hey here is how your distribution going on here are the roots right so and we got the solution out there um then what has happened is covid hit then we said okay everything is going down let's um we said let's let's only survive let's see what would happen okay So um I told my team guys you know I could only pay half or less than that if it is okay let's continue if it is not uh then you know that is how it is you know that's why the situation is fortunate that most of my team remained um uh intact so prior to co uh I happened to travel to Australia a couple of times work with a major uh supply chain company over there trying to understand this problem in detail so uh once we have the problem once when when when we were putting the solution together I traveled extensively met at least 50 customers what are the older products that are currently used and where the technology is going right now how can we solve so the current products that are being used is they use a offline monitoring recorder that would say that this vaccine has come in so and so temperature Instead of that you know we we said why don't we build an intelligent device that would send data always connected and all so during co you were building the product or did you have any prototype ready we had couple of versions precoid already all right all right yes yes so we did the product was already there we could have gone for mass prod
uction but the co hit we stopped it there so extensive uh customer visits only gave then we listed all the functionalities okay here are these kinds of customers these needs the these functionality so we used to do it on big uh uh A2 A3 size papers and then map the functionality and say that okay here is our product going to look like and we built the product then the COVID hit and um and then what has happened is uh the the major logistics jo giant in D uh in Australia uh said that we partnered with government of Australia to distribute vaccine across the continent and then and then D um and then um New Zealand government also said the same thing so they asked us you will be our monitoring partners across the supply chain um so these countries Australia and New Zealand were importing vaccine from from different country uh and then the vaccine was stored in one major hub in um uh in Australia and from there the distribution would start and that is where we start monitoring the vaccine and um but we got the order but it means preparation met opportunity your timing must have been very strong was very strong yeah the timing was very strong we played completely in our um favor yeah uh yeah but what has happened is um uh the chip market has completely went down so the the chips that we used in our designs were no more available and my team was put in various parts of the country so um it it was impossible to pull that order we got a major u uh major order from this uh logistics giant but then how do we um how do we fulfill the order that was the question we had so yeah so luckily you know the team was so supportive um I'm I'm fortunate to have built that team again uh you know thanks to because building the team the emphasis came from uh my uh lectures at um my classes at school of entrepreneurship of uh you used to always ask where is your team you know are you lone team member why don't you find a team so we fortunate that we built that team and then the team was intact so we said okay let's build a new product with what is available in the market so I'm here I'm here yes yes so we uh we said okay we we scrapped everything we had we had done like six seven iterations by then we said let's scrap everything um soft
ware is software was easy to scrap and rebuild so we said okay all the firmware code all the I think 18 to 24 months of testing and development we scrapped everything and then we kind of built everything in next two weeks of time and you have only two weeks so um and um between uh the two covid covids there was some gap so I asked everybody to come to Hyderabad one city and then we said let's go to office in the morning us because that's when the there was a you can move around the city so we would go to office build a product entirely in two weeks of time and then we sent out designs for manufacturing and um that's how we kind of fulfilled that order and um you know that triggered a major investment uh into the company and that triggered a geographical we were then only you know we were we had an office in Australia then then that triggered a office in uh um um um US Atlanta uh we we were triing with a lot of customers over there right and um yeah so yeah that was the journey and then uh then my board said you know we need somebody who's experienced to run the company and then I said well that is good then the thought was the thought that was inside my mind was okay how what should I do so that you know pay was not the problem what should I do so that I would create 100 million value in next two years of time so that would not come if I if I join some other company uh if I go and work in US right so I would be working for somebody in right so that's when uh my current co-founder Ash said okay there is a problem statement uh if played well uh we can revolutionize the software development uh way um how we can quickly bring up the applications out there so and then uh I kind of fell in line because while I was building my previous uh product the cycles of development has impacted a lot so the the entire thought was how to bring um prototypes and POC's to faster deployable code scalable code right scalable products and that was the thought we start started with once again I start restarted everything from zero and uh in again again then when you restart there is no guarantee that your product would be hit in the first go right it together product new industry you have to understand the problem problem statement
people and all of that so in here also we are going through multiple cycles once again that's how we started broken atom right recover covered most of it man right right so um Prashant u one uh question because you are one person who started up as a student and then you continue to be in startup mode again meaning I'll use the same uh phrase in the sense that you you now know how you want to build from a scratch and you can build from a concept to to uh scale and then you have the strength and uh the capability to take a call when you need to exit and then also make a new effort correct yes so Prashant uh tell us about the key drivers for your decisions meaning you uh when we look at the guest survey for example one of the findings was that most of the stu most of the students excuse me most of the students expect to take up employment first and then go into entrepreneurship almost uh 38% if my numbers uh serve my memory serves me right are interested in starting up but they want to do it after 5 years of employment in your it was you have decided consciously not to take up employment um tell us about these the key drivers for this decision um yes so entrepreneurship started for me as a you know exploratory act act activity as first um I used to always think that you know so many smart um ITNs uh or nits major institute graduate PhDs graduate and I used to always think where are all they going okay so um then I felt okay once you are out of IIT you would work for couple of years um or we go for masters do it two year master cycle over there um or you work couple of years in India and uh you get married and you fall into the cycle of life and you're not free until you are 40 or 45 until your kid leaves your home right uh that was one one thought uh and second my sister and family lives in US and uh I was looking at the seniors from my college um what happens is when you go for masters you need to retain your visa over there so you fe you'll have to keep trapped yourself for every twoear cycle you know someone has to sponsor you you have to work very well for them right I would otherwise no one would want you to be there right so and then you fall in that trap and I mean there's good trap of course there's good
standard of living over there good life and in fact it here also you get paid well and then you get married and it's a it's a it's a trap in a way I mean this it's a good trap to have right so in both ways it is same I mean you you fall into the cycle of life so the thought was when is the time to explore and learn fast and do things quickly right so that is as soon as you graduate because the moment you go for masters uh if you're uh then you'll have to take a loan or there is a financial burden there is a comparison right um or you go for a job then you always compare your salary with your friend salary or next job better job so I said okay the right time to explore is now couple of years now and uh right time to do understand fasten your cycle is now and then as I started that I as I started entrepreneurship then I realized okay let's look at the list of entrepreneurs and what it took them to make an impact in the market so let's not look at um few people who had made an impact in very few years of time they started entrepreneurship but the average um average uh span they make an impact is no less than a decade I mean you would right I mean half a decade for sure right so half a decade for any startup to have it any name on the market so so well when I started I figured out how to survive first right you by doing entrepreneurship you can survive too so once I've survived okay how would I build the consistency and build the company and then you know reach that time where I make the impact so yeah so so you a first generation entrepreneur right yeah I'm a first generation entrepreneur in my family what was your family outlook like towards this kind of a decision it must have been disruptive circle at least so I made some rules yeah definitely i come from a farming uh family um so we said because I made some rules like I would not take a penny from home so that would stop half a half a noise coming from there and whenever I can I'll contribute back home so that would stop most of it right uh so and then they were always saying why don't you take up a job and all I said you know um how does it matter I I started to earn after two years of my entrepreneurship journey so that two years was where I said I'll not ta
ke money from home and yeah so they were supportive initially they were suggesting me and uh given that you know nobody is as educated as I was in the family i mean yeah so immediate family was fairly educated but I think they were okay for me to try couple of years but in that time I figured out a way to make money and so yeah that's right that's right my father want me to do government job though yet right exactly exactly so navigating through that is uh is not easy especially family expectations so you did have a conversation with yourself right to identify how you want to navigate through the family pressure about your decision right tell us about the so uh I mean that was so much uh to unpack in whatever you shared so far um three companies broken atom is the third company right um you have also shared how you got into an entrepreneurship course and option the option was that it'll help me get off easily so today as you look back on your journey are there any regrets do you think you would have done things differently anything there there are no regrets as such uh ma'am um right now there are no regrets in the journey i would say it's been like 9 8 n years since I graduated but I uh unpack I feel that I've gained the knowledge of 30 years uh working in India navigating navigating through various parts of the country um so there are no regrets i know how would how a Delhiite would uh behave how would Mumbai behave how a South Indian behave um in a team culture I mean in a when you are talking to uh people from who who do you who customers who want to genuinely support you customers who uh want to squeeze as much as out of you so I could unpack um learn all that experience a conventional person a MBA graduate would learn in 10 12 years of their career post all these so that way learning wise um I have no regrets at all in terms of money I guess I made what more than what I my friends could make so there are no regrets that way as well yeah absolutely absolutely so that is great so Prashant let me give you another statistic from the guest survey okay so one one of the findings was that 4.8% of the students who responded to our survey are already running a business venture the global figure for this is 11% oka
y uh what do you think should Sorry ma'am can I get the question once again yes yes so the guest uh in the guest survey the students who responded to us we found that 4.8% of these students are already running their own business ventures right 4 4.8% 8% of the students right we got students from across the country right now now the global average of student entrepreneurship is 11% okay how what do you think should be done to improve this number the percentage of students entering entrepreneurship as a student first of all do you think it should be a goal that we encourage more and more students to take up entrepreneurship secondly what can change yeah so how I'm looking at that ma'am is introduction to entrepreneurship um for me was done by choice right but imagine introduction to entrepreneurship was done by force just a pun but yeah so I think it should be done like early um early in um graduate schools uh by not by choice but by you know we do we do introduction to humanities we do introduction to biosciences why not introduction to entrepreneurship right that would so what will happen is I took uh introduction to entrepreneurship by choice you know when you say by choice I think 10 20% of people would only want to you know look at that right and then I did it my third I in third year second semester also um or early fourth year so um so it came out as a lot of one it came out as a choice right and it came in the third or fourth year of my bachelors and then it came out of multiple options that I have you know I could go for an MBA I could go for uh a um job or I could go for masters or PhD right uh so but what if this is made as a a compulsory course in uh um in all the graduate schools right and to be done in you know second year or later second year I I don't know I don't know when is the right time but then what would happen is um the thinking would change for a lot of students the number would sharply rise you know if what if there was a course on registering a company doing transactions right handling customers making Excel sheets right filing GST and then how to run a basic company so I think that numbers will not I can't say it will double but quadruple uh if these activities are done that's right th
at's right because it's you know it it it'll not it's a theor can be a theoretical course where students or you know for me I used to we used to do MA like MA courses and we are second order differential equation courses somebody who's doing all these um introduction to entrepreneurship should be an easy course right you know there can be case studies there can be so what would happen is that would take away all the fear of starting up um and entrepreneurs can you know students can be entrepreneurs while doing their bachelors and um and can get out much more confident um that's how I believe yeah right right so Brandant since you mentioned the course introduction to entrepreneurship in your case the person who took it was an entrepreneur himself somebody who'been there done that and when you heard straight from the horse's mouths so to say there is a certain impact uh how would students accept it from an academician somebody who's an educator and who's interested in entrepreneurship of course and taking this course teaching this course would students be as accepting as lessons from an entrepreneur directly i think um there has to be a strong attractor to uh these courses initially um because uh um it it it happens by crowd itself you know when you know when I was uh there used to come seniors who would be like I keep seeing uh the post from uh uh LinkedIn that you know Bavi Shagarwal went to IIT Bombay and then the lecture hall is full of students so yeah what would happen is initially it it can't be the entrepreneurs teaching these courses because their learning will be only limited to some sectors there has to academicians has to come uh put out case studies and put out a theoretical plan because they are the researchers behind all these entrepreneurs so it has to be a combination a combination well curated so that you pull the crowd initially that's how I'm looking it interesting very interesting uh what else would you add to this uh formula of classroom classroom course on entrepreneurship do you think factors like mentoring funding team formation incubation will they uh play a role at such an early stage yeah so in my case all the credit goes to goes to uh the city center for entrepreneurship all like you
were there I met you over there and all the credit goes to the staff over there the city center um so no doubt um there was a layer protecting us there was a layer curating environment uh that would um bring out the crazy thoughts in our brains and validate and you know so the incubation centers entrepreneurship schools definitely play a much much bigger role when I when I think right and uh because you need to have somebody who would listen to your crazy ideas right you know otherwise they are only then they only remain crazy ideas so So me and my friend um from bachelors we had we were working on an idea similar to practto back in 2014 so uh and we went to uh sign center for entrepreneurship and then we said can we do it and they said why not you know you guys just come down we will help you in registering the company we'll help you unfortunately we did not perceive that idea but what I'm saying is uh you know whenever we meet we always ask oursel oh we should have done that right okay so that's it yeah I think they play a major role because um students are like often um are clueless correct correct so at an institutional uh so let let's uh close this one segment about your student entrepreneurship what pitfalls do students face when they have all these ideas that you were talking about what is it that stops them from taking that one step in experimenting or starting up i think uh it's it's to do more with uh competition within friends competition within departments of uh securing a job securing uh uh securing a seat in masters um all right so um they are competing uh to do what is next best thing amongst friends so the entire thought process of dealing with uncertaintity is not taught anywhere right i think that I think that plays a major role correct correct that plays a big role right yes that's such a strong insight prashant you in your first venture that you were experimenting with you were doing it as a part of your course you mentioned right technology venture creation yes so you got in touch with the defense you said the CRPF came in and all how did you manage that being a student so we were a team of uh then we were a team of four people uh one of us on the communication side uh working with IIT Bom
bay had made the introduction through their um I think there's a center called uh um center for which which connects to the industry and industrial bodies okay so they made the introduction and uh we met the defense uh they work with defense yes they work with defense as well so they made the introduction and then uh uh then CRPF had an open problem statement of somebody solving this and we said we would want to do something in robotics and why don't we pick this as problem statement so correct so let's go to the next part uh here what kind of uh so the next segment will be related to institutional level or policy level interventions that Yeah so what kind of interventions do you think will bridge this gap which will and encourage more students to explore entrepreneurship yeah so first the point number one should be um um should we should the the the educational institutes institutions should introduce entrepreneurship and that is not happening like you know that is happening as a choice now you have bunch of 100 courses to take you pick one or two and then the chances are you know two three percentage so right um the introduction can happen much earlier um the second one is um I don't know how this is to be done but you know the students mindset should be changed in such a way that it is okay to have a couple of years of your life to be in exploratory life you know postgraduation right um you know when I look at the history and statistics of my the people that I know right it's not that everybody who has gone for PhD in a um you know ranked number one university had done you know so great a job right so um there is no standard formula so the standard formula can be somehow I don't know you know teaching students that they can explore things uh a year or two postgraduation trying to solve some problem statements right so um that has to be brought down that that would be my second point okay yeah third yeah i think I think these are the two points uh somehow yes sorry it's complete somehow if these two things um gets uh into the students mind early it would be yeah number of entrepreneurs coming out can be quadrupled correct correct correct so there is uh yet another guess finding that I would like to share with
you according According to this report 63% of student entrepreneurs have access to university support for developing ventures but only 26% of these student ventures get incubation uh what are the gaps that you have observed in the incubation ecosystems in educational institutions yeah so there are I mean in fact this comes from experience itself um the incubation ecosystem has to um own the entrepreneurship entrepreneurs in the early stage like sometimes what would happen is um for example um um like in in in in IIT the I think there was a the ecosystem was definitely there you have to apply for um you have to apply for some schemes so that you know they would put some money um uh there has to be a groundwork that has to be done uh right um then present it to the committee and then uh so what would happen is all of this is done as a all of this has to be done as an extra activity apart from your academics correct exactly from my from my experience um academics was too intensive uh at at IIT Bombay uh it was quite consuming uh then you have extracurriculars then you have friends right so when all of us has to be part of your life over there and uh then you have to do entrepreneurship that means you have to pull all together one or two courses apart from what you're doing right so um one incentive for the students could be you know just like there was an elective for me that enabled me to to take a course on entrepreneurship Uh there can be electives that says that hey you work on an entrepreneurship idea equivalent to some quotes equivalent to some credits and credit credits come together for a degree right so that can be an so students literally going to these entrepreneurship buildings and then sitting there and working um trying building a cult out of entrepreneurship uh can be one incentive for students right so that they're at least visiting they're trying to do something just like I would visit um lecture halls for my lectures but they are just lecture halls so but what if lot of teams working over there in dedicated buildings and and these are considered in the grading system in the point and then these are attached to uh I mean these schools are attached to incubation centers and then right if if there
is a if there is a journey that can be curated correct that that would help a lot I guess a pathway within the institution as a pathway within the institution a fail safe entrepreneurial journey yes right right now all of that is coming out of a narrow choice to you Right right so you mentioned I Bombay and definitely facilities at IIT Bombay meaning resources uh is not a constraint in that in IITB but what about tier 2 and tier three cities or what about institutions within Mumbai who do not have access to the same kind of ecosystem support what they will really have to pull out budgets and build on this what is the for them to take it forward for universities or institutions i think in that would come as a major um educational policy change uh uh uh where uh these institutes should be incentivized in some way through grading so I see that these institutions get graded on some metrics but why shouldn't that metric be entrepreneurship as a major metric right uh that would change the economy I I I some way so um yes yes yes true so what about the private sector Brashant we've spoken about the educational sector Uh sorry ma'am I missed something yeah yes no no no problem we spoke about the educational sector we spoke about uh what can be done for incubation what kind of uh free funding ideas can be implemented and all of that what do you think corporations VCs and accelerators can do in this space to incentivize um either students in educational institutions or institutions themselves to encourage venture venture creation i think even in tier two tire three cities um there are lot of industries uh if if these education institutions are somehow able to connect with these uh industries and get them on board there so that these these people will bring out problem statements to the institutions that's right okay so the industry will provide the problem statement you meant yeah so because what is happening is a student like me would never understand uh you know for me it is a frustrating world but we would never know what the problem out there is the problem that could pay right that's the basis for entrepreneurship a problem that is worth solving that has a market to it that has a scalability to it so um at any tire
city there can be a a combination of incubators educational institutions and industry out there right uh uh so everybody incubation center education is bringing entrepreneurs or students incubation is an environment they get um they get nurtured But uh industry can bring the problem statement government can have a little bit of early um some funding or some way to support this and if this is part of uh a policy or part of educational rethinking I believe it can do wonders absolutely absolutely so Prashant one last question and uh uh before I close I would like to kind of uh also speak to you mention that we will come back to you for any more further insights because there are so many things that have come out in whatever you said that when our team analyzes it there will be more uh questions we would like to come back to you absolutely no I'm always available man yes one one last uh question what would be one bold hack to uh that you would share for aspiring student entrepreneurs how can they start and how can they overcome the fear of failure i think I've uh repeat yes is there one hack for it or are there more than one hack what you can ask me i think there has to be the habit of um I mean uh you know a year going or year or two going waste shouldn't matter in early stages of um building a career career so um I think you it should be okay to explore new things uh the journey don't have to be super perfect uh I graduated then I got into masters then I got into job then I got it don't have to be super perfect right you know I somehow feel uncertainity is the uh root for creation and then creation of any kind or innovation of any kind so that would start with the uncertaint uncertaintity uh the students would want to take at the and it would have high reverse hurts later on um right so yeah yeah that's what I said it is okay to you know try something new for a year or two there's nothing wrong you start you want to be an entrepreneur in the fourth year because that's a deciding year do you want to do MBA masters or take up a job but why not entrepreneurship and pursue it for couple of years and there's nothing wrong as as as soon as this thing goes into the heads of student entrepreneurs um the retainership in t
he student entrepreneurship would increase drastically correct and and uh supposing they don't start up but they have developed the mindset I think even the problem solving mindset like you mentioned identifying problem statements solving problems even if they've developed the mindset towards that I think it's a job well done yes because you once you become a micro entrepreneur then you would always when you join a fairly larger organization you would want to always the problem finder and solver um to this day I look it way only um um even today's day I align my team in what is the problem and how do we solve this you know how do we put aside all um hierarchal egos aside and get to the problem solve it in time that is the mindset I guess that would help in any profession they take absolutely on that note thank you so much Brashant this was very rich uh interview with so many inputs because it's rare that we get to talk to entrepreneurs who start off as students and build three companies like you have and share so much along the way thank you so much for this thank you very much ma'am glad to be part of this yes happy to be part of any conversations in the future yeah do let me know fantastic thank you so much Brashan thank you
