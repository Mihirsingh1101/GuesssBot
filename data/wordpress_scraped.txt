The GUESSS India 2023 Survey received responses from 13,896 students across 1298 higher education institutions in India, making it one of the most comprehensive studies on student entrepreneurship in the country.
How was the GUESSS India 2023 Survey conducted?
The GUESSS India 2023 Survey was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed to students across 156 higher education institutions in India. The survey covered a wide range of questions aimed at understanding students’ career intentions, entrepreneurial activities, and perceptions of their university’s entrepreneurship climate.
What types of institutions were included in the survey?
The survey primarily targeted the Top 100 Institutions from the NIRF 2023 Innovation Category and 88 Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs). Additionally, several other higher educational institutions were included in the survey. Overall, students enrolled in 1298 Indian institutions provided their responses for the survey. The coverage includes universities, technical institutes, colleges, and other higher education establishments, ensuring a diverse representation of students from various academic backgrounds.
What methodology was used for data collection?
The survey utilized an online questionnaire distributed via institutional networks, social media channels, and strategic partners who had direct communication with Indian students. A network of on campus Campus-Ambassadors was leveraged by the survey team. The questionnaire consisted of a mix of multiple-choice questions, and Likert-scale rating questions to capture the data.
How is the distinction between nascent and active entrepreneurs made in the survey?
Students were classified as nascent entrepreneurs if they were in the process of starting a venture but had not yet generated consistent revenue for more than three months.

India ranks highly in terms of entrepreneurial intent and nascent venture activity among top startup economies. However, it lags behind its global peers, such as the US and Germany, in terms of active ventures – students running revenue-generating businesses. This reflects a strong entrepreneurial pipeline but also indicates the need for enhanced support to bridge the gap between intent and execution.
Why is the GUESSS India 2023 Report important for universities and educators?
The report highlights the crucial role universities play in fostering entrepreneurship among students. It reveals that 63% of student entrepreneurs receive university support, and students rate the university entrepreneurship climate in India as highly positive (4.7/7). The findings offer universities a roadmap for enhancing their entrepreneurship curricula, programs, and incubation facilities to better support student ventures.
What impact does the GUESSS India 2023 Report have on the future of India’s startup ecosystem?

University Entrepreneurship Climate
Javeed Dar
October 10, 2024
In the last few years, India has made significant strides toward becoming a global hub for entrepreneurship. At the heart of this movement are Indian universities, which are beginning to play a crucial role in nurturing entrepreneurial skills and mindsets among their students. The GUESSS India 2023 report, a pioneering study, dives deep into the entrepreneurial spirit of Indian students and their universities’ roles in fostering this ecosystem. This report sheds light on both the progress made and the areas where Indian universities need to further enhance their entrepreneurial support.
Universities as Catalysts for Entrepreneurship
Universities are traditionally seen as institutions for academic knowledge and research, but in today’s fast-evolving world, they are increasingly being recognized as critical enablers of entrepreneurship. Across the globe, universities are adapting to the growing demand for innovation-driven education by incorporating entrepreneurial programs and providing the resources needed for students to turn their ideas into tangible ventures. In India, this transition is gaining momentum, with the GUESSS India 2023 report offering key insights into how universities are progressing in this regard.
According to the report, Indian students are increasingly recognizing their universities as places that support entrepreneurial growth. When surveyed, students rated the entrepreneurial climate of their universities at 4.66 on a 7-point Likert scale. This relatively high rating reflects the sense that universities are no longer limited to fostering academic achievements alone but are becoming spaces where entrepreneurial ideas can take root and grow. However, as promising as this is, there remain critical gaps in support systems that need to be addressed.
Creating an Environment for Entrepreneurial Growth
One of the most notable findings from the GUESSS India 2023 report is the overall positive sentiment students hold toward their universities’ entrepreneurial climates. A score of 4.8 on the Likert scale, indicating that students feel their universities are encouraging them to engage in entrepreneurial activities, suggests that these institutions are actively promoting innovation. This is crucial because the environment in which students are encouraged to explore their entrepreneurial aspirations can have a profound impact on whether or not those ideas flourish.
The report highlights several factors that contribute to creating a positive entrepreneurial environment within universities. These include:
Supportive Policies: The National Innovation and Startup Policy (NISP) 2019 and the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020 have laid the groundwork for universities to integrate entrepreneurship into their curricula and support systems. These policies encourage universities to establish innovation cells, provide incubation centers, and offer seed funding to student-led ventures. By aligning with national initiatives, universities are becoming integral to India’s broader mission of creating a startup-friendly ecosystem.
Encouraging Atmosphere: Students need an atmosphere that fosters creativity, risk-taking, and problem-solving. The report suggests that Indian universities are making strides in this area by offering platforms for students to engage in entrepreneurial activities, such as business idea competitions, hackathons, and entrepreneurship-focused workshops.
Access to Resources: One of the essential components of a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem is access to resources—both financial and physical. While many universities have established incubation centers and innovation labs, the report notes that these resources are not always widely accessible to all students. Bridging this gap is vital to ensuring that every student, regardless of background, has the opportunity to explore their entrepreneurial ambitions.
Entrepreneurship Education: Key to Building Future Entrepreneurs
A significant component of nurturing entrepreneurship is formal education. The GUESSS India 2023 report reveals that 49.8% of Indian students have been exposed to entrepreneurship education. However, while this number is encouraging, it also points to a considerable portion of students—58.8%—who have not yet participated in any entrepreneurship courses. This is a clear indication that while progress is being made, there is still much work to be done in terms of integrating entrepreneurship into the broader academic curriculum.
Among the students who have engaged with entrepreneurship education, 40.4% have completed a compulsory course, while 22.7% have opted for elective courses. This shows that while entrepreneurship is being offered as an academic subject, it is still largely optional in many universities. Given the importance of entrepreneurial skills in today’s fast-paced, innovation-driven world, it is crucial that universities make entrepreneurship education more accessible, offering it as a core part of the curriculum for students across all fields of study—not just those in business programs.
Furthermore, the report emphasizes the need for experiential learning. Entrepreneurship is not something that can be fully taught through lectures and textbooks alone. Students need hands-on experience in building businesses, working in teams, pitching their ideas to investors, and navigating the challenges of launching a startup. Universities that offer practical, real-world opportunities for students to engage in entrepreneurship are likely to see the greatest success in fostering the next generation of innovators.
University Support Systems: The Backbone of Student Entrepreneurship
In addition to formal education, students need access to a comprehensive support system if they are to succeed as entrepreneurs. The GUESSS India 2023 report highlights that 64.4% of students surveyed have received some form of support from their universities. This support comes in various forms, including mentorship, funding, technical assistance, and incubation space. However, the data also reveals that 35.6% of students have not received any support, indicating a gap that universities must work to fill.
One of the most critical forms of support that universities can provide is mentorship. According to the report, 20.6% of students reported having access to mentorship programs, which provide them with valuable guidance from experienced entrepreneurs and business leaders. Mentorship is a vital resource for young entrepreneurs, as it helps them navigate the challenges of starting and growing a business. Having someone who has been through the entrepreneurial journey can offer insights, advice, and networks that are otherwise inaccessible to students.
While mentorship is relatively well-established, other forms of support, such as financial assistance, are less prevalent. Only 9.7% of students reported receiving financial help from their universities, and 8.4% reported access to technical support. This indicates a need for universities to expand their support offerings, particularly in areas that require significant resources, such as seed funding, grants, and access to advanced technology.
Incubation and Innovation Centers: Bridging the Gap Between Ideas and Execution
A major development in Indian universities’ approach to entrepreneurship has been the establishment of incubation and innovation centers. Since 2018, the Ministry of Education’s Innovation Cell (MIC) has set up 14,422 Institute Innovation Councils (IICs) across higher education institutions. These centers act as bridges between students’ ideas and their execution, providing the physical space, tools, and resources needed to develop business prototypes, create business models, and ultimately launch startups.
These incubation centers often provide a range of services, including mentorship, financial resources, access to investors, and technical expertise. For many student entrepreneurs, having access to such facilities can make the difference between a business idea remaining a dream and becoming a reality. The GUESSS report highlights the importance of these centers in shaping students’ entrepreneurial journeys, noting that students who engage with incubation centers are more likely to successfully launch their ventures.
However, the report also notes that while these centers exist, they are not always accessible to all students. Expanding access to incubation and innovation centers should be a priority for universities, ensuring that students from all academic disciplines and backgrounds can benefit from these critical resources.
The Importance of Tailored Support and Flexibility
One of the key takeaways from the GUESSS India 2023 report is the need for universities to offer tailored support to meet the diverse needs of student entrepreneurs. Not all students require the same type of assistance—some may need help refining their business ideas, while others may need technical resources or financial backing. Universities must recognize that entrepreneurship is not a one-size-fits-all process and should offer a range of services that cater to different stages of the entrepreneurial journey.
Additionally, the report highlights the importance of flexibility in how universities provide support. For instance, offering access to pitch competitions, hackathons, and venture-building programs can provide students with the real-world experience they need to refine their ideas and develop the confidence to present their businesses to investors. Similarly, creating platforms for students to engage with external stakeholders, such as industry leaders and venture capitalists, can help them secure the funding and mentorship they need to scale their ventures.
The Road Ahead: Strengthening University Support for Entrepreneurship
The GUESSS India 2023 report provides valuable insights into the progress Indian universities have made in creating a supportive entrepreneurial environment. However, it also highlights areas where improvement is necessary. As India continues to position itself as a global leader in entrepreneurship, universities must step up their efforts to provide students with the tools, resources, and education they need to succeed.
Moving forward, universities should focus on expanding access to entrepreneurship education, making it a core part of the curriculum for students across all disciplines. Additionally, they must work to bridge the gap in support systems, ensuring that all students—regardless of background or academic focus—have access to the mentorship, funding, and technical assistance they need to bring their business ideas to life.
Moreover, universities must continue to invest in their incubation and innovation centers, expanding these facilities and making them more accessible to a broader range of students. By doing so, they can help cultivate a new generation of entrepreneurs who are well-equipped to navigate the challenges of launching and scaling successful businesses.
Conclusion
The GUESSS India 2023 report paints a hopeful picture of the future of entrepreneurship in Indian universities. While there is much to celebrate, there is also significant room for growth. Universities have a critical role to play in shaping the next generation of entrepreneurs, and by building on the progress they have already made, they can create a vibrant and inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem that empowers students to innovate, take risks, and drive India’s economy forward.

The coverage includes universities, technical institutes, colleges, and other higher education establishments, ensuring a diverse representation of students from various academic backgrounds.
What methodology was used for data collection?
The survey utilized an online questionnaire distributed via institutional networks, social media channels, and strategic partners who had direct communication with Indian students. A network of on campus Campus-Ambassadors was leveraged by the survey team. The questionnaire consisted of a mix of multiple-choice questions, and Likert-scale rating questions to capture the data.
How is the distinction between nascent and active entrepreneurs made in the survey?
Students were classified as nascent entrepreneurs if they were in the process of starting a venture but had not yet generated consistent revenue for more than three months. Active entrepreneurs are those whose ventures have moved beyond the nascent stage and have been operational long enough to generate revenue and/or pay wages for at least three months.
How does the GUESSS India 2023 Report ensure representative data?
The survey’s sample includes students from a diverse range of academic institutions, regions, and fields of study, ensuring that the data reflects the variety of experiences within India’s student population. The inclusion of both undergraduate and postgraduate students, across different types of institutions, helps provide a broad and representative dataset.
How does the GUESSS India 2023 Report contribute to understanding the Indian startup ecosystem?
The report provides a detailed analysis of student entrepreneurial aspirations, highlighting opportunities and challenges in nurturing the next generation of entrepreneurs in India. It helps universities, incubators, policymakers, and investors understand key trends and areas where more support is needed to turn entrepreneurial intent into successful ventures.
How does India compare to other countries in the GUESSS survey?
India ranks highly in terms of entrepreneurial intent and nascent venture activity among top startup economies. However, it lags behind its global peers, such as the US and Germany, in terms of active ventures – students running revenue-generating businesses. This reflects a strong entrepreneurial pipeline but also indicates the need for enhanced support to bridge the gap between intent and execution.
Why is the GUESSS India 2023 Report important for universities and educators?
The report highlights the crucial role universities play in fostering entrepreneurship among students. It reveals that 63% of student entrepreneurs receive university support, and students rate the university entrepreneurship climate in India as highly positive (4.7/7). The findings offer universities a roadmap for enhancing their entrepreneurship curricula, programs, and incubation facilities to better support student ventures.
What impact does the GUESSS India 2023 Report have on the future of India’s startup ecosystem?
The report demonstrates the vast potential of India’s student entrepreneurs to contribute to the country’s startup ecosystem. With nearly one-third of students aspiring to become entrepreneurs within five years, the findings highlight the need for continued investment in education, incubation, and policy support to cultivate the next generation of successful founders.

Indian Students and the Entrepreneurial Spirit

“As the startup ecosystem in India continues to thrive, the latest GUESSS India 2023 report has revealed a telling insight: Indian students, once largely focused on traditional employment, are now increasingly setting their sights on entrepreneurship as a long-term career choice. The survey offers an illuminating look at this shift, providing policymakers, educational institutions, and the corporate world with crucial data to guide the future of India’s workforce”.
At the heart of every nation’s progress lies the potential of its youth. India’s youth is on the cusp of an entrepreneurial revolution. As India positions itself to become the world’s third-largest economy, the career aspirations of its students are shifting. The GUESSS India Survey report 2023 offers a fascinating window into this transformation, it examines these transformations in an interesting way and explains how though a large number of students continue to seek traditional employment after graduating, a growing number are embracing world of entrepreneurship. This isn’t just a trend; it’s a movement.
The report led by Prof Puran Singh, at Indian institute of technology Mandi, provides valuable insights into the entrepreneurial intention, attitude and behaviour of Indian students enrolled in higher education institutions, emphasizing that students in India are not only envisioning bigger goals but also actively strategizing on how to transform those aspirations into actual achievements. For policymakers, educators, and business leaders, this presents a critical juncture that demands prompt action to nurture and uphold this entrepreneurial spirit.
A Shift in Career Aspirations
The GUESSS India 2023 survey reveals a striking shift in the career intentions of Indian students. Immediately after graduation, a significant 69.7% of students plan to enter traditional employment, but five years later, that number drops dramatically to 52.2%. In contrast, the desire to start entrepreneurial ventures more than doubles, from 14% at graduation to 31.4% five years down the line.
This data presents a remarkable shift: while students may initially seek the stability of a traditional job, their long-term aspirations are increasingly entrepreneurial. The draw of entrepreneurship, where innovation meets independence, is becoming more irresistible to India’s youth as they envision themselves creating something new and lasting.
The Entrepreneurial Tide is Rising
The proportion of students intending to become entrepreneurs grows significantly over time. Students with family business background also demand a higher preference for entrepreneurship , With 15.6% intending to start their own ventures upon graduation, compared to 12.8% of students without a business background. 26% of Indian students are linked to an incubation centre , indicating they have access to support services and approximately 49% of students have engaged in entrepreneurship courses higher than the global average of 41.2% .
Global Trends, Local Insights
This shift is not unique to India. Globally, the GUESSS 2023 report reveals similar trends, with 65.9% of students worldwide planning to start their careers as employees immediately after graduation, and 53.3% intending to remain in traditional employment five years later. Meanwhile, the proportion of students planning to become founders globally jumps from 15.7% to 30% over the same period. However, India’s numbers tell a particularly compelling story. The entrepreneurial inclination of Indian students is rapidly catching up with global figures, driven by a unique combination of policy support, cultural shifts, and the country’s own booming start-up ecosystem.
A Supportive Environment for Aspiring Entrepreneurs
Several factors contribute to the entrepreneurial ambitions of students in India. The country’s startup ecosystem is thriving, bolstered by government efforts to foster innovation through programs such as Start-up India and the New Education Policy (NEP), which advocates for entrepreneurship within higher education. Additionally, educational initiatives that incorporate hands-on entrepreneurial training into their curricula, along with increasing media coverage of successful start-ups, are motivating a new wave of individuals to explore the possibility of establishing their own businesses. Such innitiatives are playing pivotal role in making entrepreneurship a mainstream aspiration, bringing start-up culture into Indian living rooms and motivating students to think big. These influences, coupled with India’s recent growth as a global start-up hub with more than 100 unicorns, have provided a solid foundation for students to see entrepreneurship as a viable, even desirable, career path.
Beyond the Classroom: What Policymakers Can Do
The GUESSS India 2023 report is not just a snapshot of student aspirations—it is a call to action for policymakers and educational institutions. To maintain and fuel this entrepreneurial drive, specific interventions are needed:
Enhanced Entrepreneurial Education: The growing entrepreneurial aspirations among students highlight the importance of integrating entrepreneurship education and practical experiences into academic curricula. That means , Universities and colleges need to focus on hands-on learning, offering start-up incubation centers, mentoring programs, and collaboration with industry leaders. Entrepreneurship must be an integral part of the education system, allowing students to experiment and innovate.
Cultivating Entrepreneurial Spirit : There needs to be a cultural shift in how society views entrepreneurship. While shows like Shark Tank India have helped, we need more initiatives that celebrate and support entrepreneurship as a legitimate, respected career option, rather than a risky alternative to traditional employment. India must persist it’s efforts through awareness programes, bootcamps , Competitions to motivate students to consider entrepreneurship as viable career path.
A Simplified Regulatory Framework: Making it easier to start and operate a business in India should be a priority. Simplified tax laws, easier access to licenses, and reduced bureaucratic red tape can help more young entrepreneurs take the plunge.
Conclusion: A New Generation of Innovators
The GUESSS India 2023 report highlights a significant evolution in the career aspirations of Indian students. While many still begin their professional journey in traditional employment, the lure of entrepreneurship is growing stronger. Policymakers, educators, and the private sector must come together to support this transition, creating an ecosystem where students can easily move from corporate roles to entrepreneurial ventures. India’s future is entrepreneurial, and this generation of students is ready to lead the charge. By harnessing their passion, creativity, and drive, India has the potential to become not just a global economic powerhouse but a leader in innovation and entrepreneurial excellence. The entrepreneurial spirit of India’s youth is not just a trend—it’s a movement that could define the nation’s future.

What is GUESSS Global
GUESSS (Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students Survey) is a biennial global research project initiated by the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, in 2003. It aims to understand entrepreneurial intent, behavior, and influencing factors among students worldwide. In 2023, 57 countries participated in the survey, collecting data from more than 300,000 students.
What is GUESSS India Cloud
GUESSS Cloud is a dedicated knowledge repository addressing key issues relevant to student entrepreneurship in India. It serves as a platform to generate knowledge that inspires entrepreneurial action, equipping students with insights, research, and expert opinions.
How many students participated in the GUESSS India 2023 Survey?
The GUESSS India 2023 Survey received responses from 13,896 students across 1298 higher education institutions in India, making it one of the most comprehensive studies on student entrepreneurship in the country.
How was the GUESSS India 2023 Survey conducted?
The GUESSS India 2023 Survey was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed to students across 156 higher education institutions in India. The survey covered a wide range of questions aimed at understanding students’ career intentions, entrepreneurial activities, and perceptions of their university’s entrepreneurship climate.
What types of institutions were included in the survey?
The survey primarily targeted the Top 100 Institutions from the NIRF 2023 Innovation Category and 88 Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs). Additionally, several other higher educational institutions were included in the survey. Overall, students enrolled in 1298 Indian institutions provided their responses for the survey. The coverage includes universities, technical institutes, colleges, and other higher education establishments, ensuring a diverse representation of students from various academic backgrounds.
What methodology was used for data collection?
The survey utilized an online questionnaire distributed via institutional networks, social media channels, and strategic partners who had direct communication with Indian students. A network of on campus Campus-Ambassadors was leveraged by the survey team. The questionnaire consisted of a mix of multiple-choice questions, and Likert-scale rating questions to capture the data.
How is the distinction between nascent and active entrepreneurs made in the survey?
Students were classified as nascent entrepreneurs if they were in the process of starting a venture but had not yet generated consistent revenue for more than three months. Active entrepreneurs are those whose ventures have moved beyond the nascent stage and have been operational long enough to generate revenue and/or pay wages for at least three months.
How does the GUESSS India 2023 Report ensure representative data?
The survey’s sample includes students from a diverse range of academic institutions, regions, and fields of study, ensuring that the data reflects the variety of experiences within India’s student population. The inclusion of both undergraduate and postgraduate students, across different types of institutions, helps provide a broad and representative dataset.
How does the GUESSS India 2023 Report contribute to understanding the Indian startup ecosystem?
The report provides a detailed analysis of student entrepreneurial aspirations, highlighting opportunities and challenges in nurturing the next generation of entrepreneurs in India. It helps universities, incubators, policymakers, and investors understand key trends and areas where more support is needed to turn entrepreneurial intent into successful ventures.
How does India compare to other countries in the GUESSS survey?
India ranks highly in terms of entrepreneurial intent and nascent venture activity among top startup economies. However, it lags behind its global peers, such as the US and Germany, in terms of active ventures – students running revenue-generating businesses. This reflects a strong entrepreneurial pipeline but also indicates the need for enhanced support to bridge the gap between intent and execution.
Why is the GUESSS India 2023 Report important for universities and educators?
The report highlights the crucial role universities play in fostering entrepreneurship among students. It reveals that 63% of student entrepreneurs receive university support, and students rate the university entrepreneurship climate in India as highly positive (4.7/7). The findings offer universities a roadmap for enhancing their entrepreneurship curricula, programs, and incubation facilities to better support student ventures.
What impact does the GUESSS India 2023 Report have on the future of India’s startup ecosystem?
The report demonstrates the vast potential of India’s student entrepreneurs to contribute to the country’s startup ecosystem. With nearly one-third of students aspiring to become entrepreneurs within five years, the findings highlight the need for continued investment in education, incubation, and policy support to cultivate the next generation of successful founders.
How can the media and stakeholders access the full GUESSS India 2023 Report?

Anybody Can Start Up: The New Era of Student Entrepreneurs
Devanshi Thakur
June 2, 2025
Students of the 21
st
century are hustlers. They’re not only wearing the academic hat but have widened their horizon by wearing the entrepreneurial hat too. The GUESSS 2023 Survey Report shows that 38% students are balancing their roles as a student as well as an entrepreneur by working on a startup. But this raises the question: what has changed in the recent years that is now enabling students to startup while studying?
The answer lies in the transformation of our universities into entrepreneurial  universities. Today Indian universities are putting together an ecosystem that creates innovators and fosters entrepreneurial skills. The government of India has been instrumental in initiating this revolution through New Education Policy (NEP) and National Innovation and Startup Policy (NISP). The current university ecosystem in India boasts of Institute Innovation Councils (IICs) set up in across 7,400 institutions, with over 2950 incubators and nearly 7500 pre-incubation centers. These numbers are a testament to the thriving entrepreneurial university ecosystem in India. The GUESSS india report show that 63% of student-led startups reported that they received support from their universities for their entrepreneurial journeys. Further, Indian students rate their University Entrepreneurial Climate higher than the global average as per the same report.
So, how does a university offer support to student startups? Here are some examples from my experience at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur:
• Most universities today have set up incubators, research parks and accelerators  to support and guide student startups. By providing key resources like seed  funding, working space, legal support, industry mentorship, and networking  opportunities; universities are giving a one-stop solution for students to start  their entrepreneurial journeys. IIT Kharagpur campus itself has four incubators in its campus that are supporting hundreds of startups and are easily accessible to all students. There are accelerator programs to train student entrepreneurs and make their startup ideas them market ready.
• Various student led groups like entrepreneurship cells and innovation cells are  key in creating a culture of entrepreneurial thinking. By organizing activities like  hackathons & and business ideation competitions, investor meets and
entrepreneurship summits, they ignite students’ entrepreneurial spirit. For  instance, the Innovation and Incubation Cell (IIC) at IIT Kharagpur is helping students connect with the alumni network of entrepreneurs and bridging the gaps between students and entrepreneurial resources through various opportunities and events.
• Universities are also strengthening research and development for innovation and  entrepreneurship. By encouraging more innovative research and assisting in  patenting and commercialization of research, universities are also fostering the entrepreneurial spirit of PhD students. IIT Kharagpur has a dedicated department  for entrepreneurship – Rajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship that offers programs in entrepreneurship, and integrates academia and practice of entrepreneurship.
If you are an entrepreneur, your time is now this is your call for action!
Entrepreneurship isn’t about where you come from anymore; it’s about what you do  now. There has never been a better time for students to start-up. The entire Indian  university ecosystem is set up to support students’ dream ventures. The risks are lower, the resources are greater, and the barriers to entry have crumbled. The question is no longer whether students can startup; it is – when they will. The students should identify real problems, build their skills by taking up entrepreneurship courses, participate in entrepreneurial activities, and engage in hands-on projects.
This is the time to leverage the university incubators, professors, mentors, and student networks. Surround yourself with diverse, driven people, and don’t be afraid to start small – launch, test, fail, adapt, and repeat. Most importantly, take action today – whether it’s pitching an idea, reaching out to a mentor, or starting a side project. Your  entrepreneurial journey begins the moment you decide to make it happen. And your university has got your back!

It aims to understand entrepreneurial intent, behavior, and influencing factors among students worldwide. In 2023, 57 countries participated in the survey, collecting data from more than 300,000 students.
What is GUESSS India Cloud
GUESSS Cloud is a dedicated knowledge repository addressing key issues relevant to student entrepreneurship in India. It serves as a platform to generate knowledge that inspires entrepreneurial action, equipping students with insights, research, and expert opinions.
How many students participated in the GUESSS India 2023 Survey?
The GUESSS India 2023 Survey received responses from 13,896 students across 1298 higher education institutions in India, making it one of the most comprehensive studies on student entrepreneurship in the country.
How was the GUESSS India 2023 Survey conducted?
The GUESSS India 2023 Survey was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed to students across 156 higher education institutions in India. The survey covered a wide range of questions aimed at understanding students’ career intentions, entrepreneurial activities, and perceptions of their university’s entrepreneurship climate.
What types of institutions were included in the survey?
The survey primarily targeted the Top 100 Institutions from the NIRF 2023 Innovation Category and 88 Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs). Additionally, several other higher educational institutions were included in the survey. Overall, students enrolled in 1298 Indian institutions provided their responses for the survey. The coverage includes universities, technical institutes, colleges, and other higher education establishments, ensuring a diverse representation of students from various academic backgrounds.
What methodology was used for data collection?
The survey utilized an online questionnaire distributed via institutional networks, social media channels, and strategic partners who had direct communication with Indian students. A network of on campus Campus-Ambassadors was leveraged by the survey team. The questionnaire consisted of a mix of multiple-choice questions, and Likert-scale rating questions to capture the data.
How is the distinction between nascent and active entrepreneurs made in the survey?
Students were classified as nascent entrepreneurs if they were in the process of starting a venture but had not yet generated consistent revenue for more than three months. Active entrepreneurs are those whose ventures have moved beyond the nascent stage and have been operational long enough to generate revenue and/or pay wages for at least three months.
How does the GUESSS India 2023 Report ensure representative data?

It helps universities, incubators, policymakers, and investors understand key trends and areas where more support is needed to turn entrepreneurial intent into successful ventures.
How does India compare to other countries in the GUESSS survey?
India ranks highly in terms of entrepreneurial intent and nascent venture activity among top startup economies. However, it lags behind its global peers, such as the US and Germany, in terms of active ventures – students running revenue-generating businesses. This reflects a strong entrepreneurial pipeline but also indicates the need for enhanced support to bridge the gap between intent and execution.
Why is the GUESSS India 2023 Report important for universities and educators?
The report highlights the crucial role universities play in fostering entrepreneurship among students. It reveals that 63% of student entrepreneurs receive university support, and students rate the university entrepreneurship climate in India as highly positive (4.7/7). The findings offer universities a roadmap for enhancing their entrepreneurship curricula, programs, and incubation facilities to better support student ventures.
What impact does the GUESSS India 2023 Report have on the future of India’s startup ecosystem?
The report demonstrates the vast potential of India’s student entrepreneurs to contribute to the country’s startup ecosystem. With nearly one-third of students aspiring to become entrepreneurs within five years, the findings highlight the need for continued investment in education, incubation, and policy support to cultivate the next generation of successful founders.

Understanding Team Dynamics in Student Startups
Neha Jaswal
June 2, 2025
In recent years, universities have become a fertile ground for innovation, with increasing numbers of students turning their ideas into ventures. But while much attention is given to ideation, funding, and market entry, one critical yet often overlooked factor determines whether these early-stage ventures gain traction or dissolve quietly:
team
!
Student startups typically begin in informal settings, between classes, during hackathons, or through casual peer conversations. Teams often form quickly around shared enthusiasm, but as academic demands intensify and individual priorities shift, these loosely structured teams start to fragment. Founders frequently deal with high turnover, inconsistent commitment, and communication breakdowns, all of which severely hinder execution.
A common pattern among student-led ventures is the shift from large, energetic teams to a lean core group within just a few months. Initial excitement gives way to practical constraints: exams, internships, and placement preparations often pull students away from consistent participation. What remains is a committed founder or, at best, a small pair, juggling product development, team coordination, and academic responsibilities simultaneously.
This kind of instability creates internal friction and affects external perception. Investors and grant bodies often view team strength as a key indicator of a startup’s reliability. A venture with mostly part-time contributors, high turnover, or vague role definitions is perceived as high-risk, regardless of the quality of the idea or prototype. Without a stable team, founders often struggle to build credibility, secure funding, or even attract early users.
Despite these challenges, many student entrepreneurs find creative ways to adapt. They bring in interns, collaborate with peers from other institutions, or leverage online platforms to maintain progress. Some even delay funding utilization, recognizing that resources are only as effective as the capacity to deploy them. These adaptive behaviours point to a key insight: while team instability is a reality, it is not insurmountable.
However, this also highlights a gap in the support systems available to student ventures. While most incubators and university programs focus on ideation and product development, structured guidance on team-building, role definition, and commitment management is often missing. Founders need support not only in business strategy or technical development but also in building and retaining functional, motivated teams.
To strengthen student entrepreneurship, institutions and support programs must offer training in leadership, collaboration, and conflict resolution. In essence, no startup succeeds on the strength of an idea alone. It is people, aligned, accountable, and committed, who turn ideas into impact. For student ventures in particular, investing in team stability is not optional; it’s foundational. Without it, even the best ideas risk being lost in the transition from classroom to market.

Why GUESSS India? Igniting the Entrepreneurial Spirit of Indian Students
Javeed Dar
October 14, 2024
“The GUESSS India 2023 survey is not just a report; it’s a call to action for all stakeholders invested in the future of India’s startup ecosystem. If we heed its insights, India’s youth can indeed become the entrepreneurs that drive the nation’s next wave of growth and innovation”.
In an age where innovation and entrepreneurship are key building blocks of global economies, understanding the entrepreneurial spirit and career aspirations of the students is crucial. For a country like India with 66 percent population under the age of 35, the choices of these young minds will shape indias’ future. As the future generation of entrepreneurs is studying in institutions of higher education, their mindset holds key to the prosperity of the economy and the country . To understand what is inside the minds of Indian students – The GUESSS India 2023 Survey Report, a comprehensive survey captures this entrepreneurial spirit, offering rich insights into the career intentions of over 13,896 students across India. But why was this survey necessary, and what does it reveal about the aspirations of Indian students?
The Need of GUESSS India
India is at a crossroads. While the country is a burgeoning global startup hub with over 100 unicorns, there remains a gap in understanding how deep the entrepreneurial spirit runs among India’s youth. Traditional surveys often focus on employment statistics or overall economic trends, but the GUESSS India survey stands out by specifically exploring the entrepreneurial intentions of students at two key points in their lives—immediately after graduation and five years later.
This focus on students is vital. They are the workforce of tomorrow, the future innovators, job creators, and economic drivers. By understanding their career aspirations policymakers, educators, and businesses can better tailor their support systems to foster the next wave of Indian entrepreneurs. GUESSS India is part of the global Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students’ Survey (GUESSS), an international research project that surveys students across more than 50 countries. It aims to uncover insights into students’ career choices and entrepreneurial intentions, making it one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind. What makes GUESSS India unique is the depth of its local focus, providing granular data specific to the Indian context while aligning with global trends. This dual perspective—global and local—makes GUESSS India a key resource for understanding how India’s youth are positioned in the global entrepreneurial landscape.
GUESSS India 2023: Key figures and findings
The GUESSS India 2023 survey, conducted across 100 institutions , engaged 13,800+ students to gauge their career intentions. The data revealed both reassuring and surprising trends. Here are the key takeaways:
69.7% of students plan to start their careers as employees immediately after graduation, with 44.9% intending to work in large businesses, 18.3% in public service, and 15.2% in academia.
Only 14% of students expressed a desire to start their own business immediately after graduation, but this figure more than doubles to31.4% five years later, indicating a growing interest in entrepreneurship over time.
3.8% of students plan to join their family business upon graduation, with this figure rising to 6.6% five years later.
Over time, students’ interest in employment decreases, with only 52.2% intending to remain employees five years after graduation, compared to 69.7% initially.
This shift indicates a growing entrepreneurial mindset among Indian students, aligning with global trends. The GUESSS Global 2023 survey similarly showed that while 65.9% of students globally intended to be employees immediately after their studies, only 53.3% maintained that intention five years later. The proportion of students planning to become entrepreneurs globally also nearly doubled from 15.7% to 30%, similar to India’s rise from 14% to 31.4%.

‘Entrepreneurship as Practice’: A Philosophy and A Tool kit for Student Startups
Gautam Mirsha
May 30, 2025
When we think of entrepreneurship, we often picture flashy success stories, Steve Jobs in a garage, Elon Musk launching rockets, or a startup founder ringing the bell at the NYSE. But beneath the glamour lies a gritty reality: entrepreneurship isn’t just a title or a destination. It’s a practice – a daily, messy, hands-on process of creating, adapting, and persisting. In this article, we’ll explore what “Entrepreneurship as Practice” really means, why it matters, and how you can embrace it to turn your ideas into action.
What Does “Entrepreneurship as Practice” Mean?
The phrase “Entrepreneurship as Practice” comes from a growing field of study that shifts the focus from entrepreneurs as mythical geniuses to entrepreneurship as something you do. It’s less about who you are and more about what you practice, day in and day out. Think of it like learning to play the guitar: you don’t become a musician by dreaming about it; you pick up the instrument, strum a few awkward chords, and keep going until it sounds right.
Researchers like Saras Sarasvathy, who developed the concept of “effectuation,” argue that entrepreneurs don’t always start with a grand plan. Instead, they begin with what they have – skills, networks, resources; and build from there. It’s a practical, improvisational approach. Rather than waiting for the perfect moment or a fully formed vision, you start small, experiment, and adjust as you go.
The Core Elements of Entrepreneurship as Practice
So, what does this look like in real life? Let’s break it down into a few key practices that define this approach:
Starting with What You’ve Got
Forget the stereotype of the entrepreneur with a million-dollar idea and venture capital on speed dial. Entrepreneurship as practice begins with your current reality. What skills do you have? Who do you know? What can you afford to risk? A graphic designer might start freelancing with a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection, while a home cook might sell meals to neighbours. The point is to use what’s in your hands rather than chasing what’s out of reach.
Learning by Doing
The theory is great, but entrepreneurship thrives in action. Every step, whether it’s building a prototype, talking to a customer, or failing spectacularly, teaches you something. Take Airbnb: its founders didn’t sit around theorizing about the sharing economy. They rented out air mattresses during a conference when hotels were booked, learned what worked, and iterated from there. Practice beats perfectionism every time.
Embracing Uncertainty
If you’re waiting for a risk-free path, you’ll never start. Entrepreneurship as practice means getting comfortable with ambiguity. You won’t have all the answers: Will this product sell? Can I trust this partner? But you move forward anyway. It’s about making decisions with limited information and adapting when the unexpected hits.
Building Relationships
No entrepreneur succeeds alone. This approach emphasizes collaboration, reaching out to mentors, customers, or even competitors to co-create opportunities. It’s less about having a Rolodex of VIPs and more about nurturing the network you already have. A coffee chat today could lead to a partnership tomorrow.
Iterating Relentlessly
Your first idea probably won’t be your best. Entrepreneurship as practice is about constant refinement. Launch a minimum viable product (MVP), gather feedback, tweak it, and repeat. Think of it like sculpting: you start with a rough block and chip away until something beautiful emerges.
Why this Mindset Matters?
In a world obsessed with overnight success, “Entrepreneurship as Practice” offers a refreshing reality check. It democratises the entrepreneurial journey, making it accessible to anyone willing to roll up their sleeves. You don’t need a trust fund, an Ivy League degree, or a genius IQ, just a willingness to act and learn.
This approach also builds resilience. When you see entrepreneurship as a practice, failures don’t define you; they’re just part of the process. A product flops? You tweak it. A pitch gets rejected? You refine it. Over time, these small, deliberate actions compound into something bigger.
Plus, it’s empowering. Instead of waiting for permission or the “right” conditions, you take control. You’re not at the mercy of market trends or gatekeepers, you’re shaping your path, one practical step at a time.
How to Put it into Practice?
Ready to give it a shot? Here’s a roadmap to start practising entrepreneurship today:
Step 1: Assess Your Means
Grab a notebook and jot down three things: what you’re good at, who you know, and what resources you can access (time, money, tools). This is your launchpad. For example, if you’re a writer with a decent social media following and a laptop, you have enough to start a blog or offer editing services.
Step 2: Pick a Small Experiment
Choose a low-stakes way to test your idea. If you’re dreaming of a bakery, don’t lease a storefront yet, bake a batch of cookies and sell them at a local market. The goal is to act quickly and learn fast.
Step 3: Talk to People
Reach out to potential customers, friends, or industry folks. Ask questions: What do they need? What would they pay for? Their feedback will guide your next move. Pro tip: listen more than you pitch.
Step 4: Reflect and Adjust
After your experiment, ask yourself: What worked? What didn’t? What surprised me? Use those insights to tweak your approach. Maybe your cookies sold out because of the unique flavour, double down on that.
Step 5: Keep Going
Entrepreneurship isn’t a one-and-done event. It’s a rhythm. Build momentum by repeating this cycle; act, learn, adapt, until you’ve got something sustainable.
The Bigger Picture
At its core, “Entrepreneurship as Practice” is about self-agency. It’s a reminder that you don’t need to wait for someone else to greenlight your dreams. Whether you’re launching a side hustle, a nonprofit, or a tech startup, the power lies in starting where you stand and building as you go.
So, what’s your next move? Maybe it’s sketching a business idea on a napkin or emailing a potential collaborator. Whatever it is, don’t overthink it, just do it. Entrepreneurship isn’t about having all the answers; it’s about practising until you find them. And who knows? A year from now, you might look back and realize that today’s small step was the start of something extraordinary.

A Coach, not an Evaluator: Educators’ Role in Nurturing Student Entrepreneurs
Dr Puran Singh
April 4, 2025
In today’s rapidly evolving entrepreneurial landscape, educators hold the key to unlocking the potential of student entrepreneurs. With India’s booming startup ecosystem and increasing emphasis on innovation, the role of educators must evolve from being mere evaluators to becoming coaches and mentors who nurture entrepreneurial thinking. Traditional academic models that rely on rigid curricula and theoretical frameworks often fail to equip students with the practical skills needed to navigate the uncertainties of entrepreneurship. Instead, educators must embrace experiential learning, allowing students to explore, experiment, fail, and iterate as they transform ideas into viable business ventures.
The traditional role of educators has largely been to assess students based on predefined criteria. While this works well in structured disciplines, entrepreneurship is inherently dynamic and requires a different approach. When student entrepreneurs are subjected to conventional evaluation methods, they may be discouraged by rigid assessments that fail to account for the iterative nature of startup development. Instead of merely grading ideas or business plans, educators must act as coaches who guide students through the complex process of venture creation.
Coaching, rather than evaluating, fosters a mindset of continuous learning. A coach does not provide direct answers but instead asks the right questions, encouraging students to think critically and solve problems creatively. This shift in approach helps students develop resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving skills – all crucial traits for entrepreneurial success. Furthermore, by adopting a coaching mindset, educators can create an environment where students feel safe to take risks, fail, and learn from their mistakes without the fear of punitive judgment.
One of the most effective ways educators can support student entrepreneurs is by integrating the Lean Startup methodology into their teaching practices. Developed by Eric Ries, the Lean Startup framework emphasizes rapid experimentation, validated learning, and iterative development. This approach aligns well with the unpredictable nature of startups, where initial ideas often require multiple refinements before achieving product-market fit.
By incorporating Lean Startup principles into entrepreneurship education, educators can help students move away from rigid business planning and towards a more dynamic, hypothesis-driven approach. Students should be encouraged to test their ideas with real customers, gather feedback, and pivot based on data rather than assumptions. This practical exposure helps bridge the gap between academic concepts and real-world applications, making entrepreneurship education more effective and impactful.
Books such as The Lean Startup by Eric Ries and The Lean Product Playbook by Dan Olsen provide valuable insights into this methodology. Additionally, educators can introduce tools like the Problem Statement Canvas and Business Model Canvas to help students structure their startup ideas and iterate efficiently.
Beyond coaching, educators must also serve as enablers of the broader startup ecosystem within academic institutions. Many universities now have incubation centers, yet only a fraction of student entrepreneurs actively engage with these resources. Educators can play a pivotal role in bridging this gap by fostering stronger connections between students and incubators, mentors, and industry professionals.
The impact of entrepreneurship education is not measured by the number of successful startups alone but by the development of individuals who think entrepreneurially, whether they launch their own ventures or drive innovation within organizations. By reimagining their role, educators can shape a generation of entrepreneurial leaders poised to make a lasting impact on India’s economic and innovation landscape.

How many students participated in the GUESSS India 2023 Survey?
The GUESSS India 2023 Survey received responses from 13,896 students across 1298 higher education institutions in India, making it one of the most comprehensive studies on student entrepreneurship in the country.
How was the GUESSS India 2023 Survey conducted?
The GUESSS India 2023 Survey was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed to students across 156 higher education institutions in India. The survey covered a wide range of questions aimed at understanding students’ career intentions, entrepreneurial activities, and perceptions of their university’s entrepreneurship climate.
What types of institutions were included in the survey?
The survey primarily targeted the Top 100 Institutions from the NIRF 2023 Innovation Category and 88 Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs). Additionally, several other higher educational institutions were included in the survey. Overall, students enrolled in 1298 Indian institutions provided their responses for the survey. The coverage includes universities, technical institutes, colleges, and other higher education establishments, ensuring a diverse representation of students from various academic backgrounds.
What methodology was used for data collection?
The survey utilized an online questionnaire distributed via institutional networks, social media channels, and strategic partners who had direct communication with Indian students. A network of on campus Campus-Ambassadors was leveraged by the survey team. The questionnaire consisted of a mix of multiple-choice questions, and Likert-scale rating questions to capture the data.
How is the distinction between nascent and active entrepreneurs made in the survey?
Students were classified as nascent entrepreneurs if they were in the process of starting a venture but had not yet generated consistent revenue for more than three months. Active entrepreneurs are those whose ventures have moved beyond the nascent stage and have been operational long enough to generate revenue and/or pay wages for at least three months.
How does the GUESSS India 2023 Report ensure representative data?

It helps universities, incubators, policymakers, and investors understand key trends and areas where more support is needed to turn entrepreneurial intent into successful ventures.
How does India compare to other countries in the GUESSS survey?
India ranks highly in terms of entrepreneurial intent and nascent venture activity among top startup economies. However, it lags behind its global peers, such as the US and Germany, in terms of active ventures – students running revenue-generating businesses. This reflects a strong entrepreneurial pipeline but also indicates the need for enhanced support to bridge the gap between intent and execution.
Why is the GUESSS India 2023 Report important for universities and educators?
The report highlights the crucial role universities play in fostering entrepreneurship among students. It reveals that 63% of student entrepreneurs receive university support, and students rate the university entrepreneurship climate in India as highly positive (4.7/7). The findings offer universities a roadmap for enhancing their entrepreneurship curricula, programs, and incubation facilities to better support student ventures.
What impact does the GUESSS India 2023 Report have on the future of India’s startup ecosystem?
The report demonstrates the vast potential of India’s student entrepreneurs to contribute to the country’s startup ecosystem. With nearly one-third of students aspiring to become entrepreneurs within five years, the findings highlight the need for continued investment in education, incubation, and policy support to cultivate the next generation of successful founders.
How can the media and stakeholders access the full GUESSS India 2023 Report?
The full report will be available for download following the official launch at ISBAcon 2024 in Hyderabad on October 18, 2024. For more information or to get a copy of the report, please visit

How was the GUESSS India 2023 Survey conducted?
The GUESSS India 2023 Survey was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed to students across 156 higher education institutions in India. The survey covered a wide range of questions aimed at understanding students’ career intentions, entrepreneurial activities, and perceptions of their university’s entrepreneurship climate.
What types of institutions were included in the survey?
The survey primarily targeted the Top 100 Institutions from the NIRF 2023 Innovation Category and 88 Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs). Additionally, several other higher educational institutions were included in the survey. Overall, students enrolled in 1298 Indian institutions provided their responses for the survey. The coverage includes universities, technical institutes, colleges, and other higher education establishments, ensuring a diverse representation of students from various academic backgrounds.
What methodology was used for data collection?
The survey utilized an online questionnaire distributed via institutional networks, social media channels, and strategic partners who had direct communication with Indian students. A network of on campus Campus-Ambassadors was leveraged by the survey team. The questionnaire consisted of a mix of multiple-choice questions, and Likert-scale rating questions to capture the data.
How is the distinction between nascent and active entrepreneurs made in the survey?
Students were classified as nascent entrepreneurs if they were in the process of starting a venture but had not yet generated consistent revenue for more than three months.

Seven Ideas for Designing and Delivering Effective FDPs
Oshin Goel
June 3, 2025
Many mid-career professionals and experienced individuals often turn to
faculty development or management development programs—typically
week-long, short-term initiatives—to enhance their skills and knowledge.
Various institutions offer these programs, which are primarily targeted at
adult learners, yet the delivery methods are often more suited to
traditional students. However, the effectiveness of these programs often
hinges on how well they are designed and delivered to meet the unique
needs of adult audiences.
In this brief note, we share seven key insights from our recent experience
of conducting such programs at the School of Management, IIT Mandi.
Drawing from the successes of our recent programs, we outline practices
that significantly enhanced participant engagement and learning
outcomes. These insights offer valuable guidance for designing and
delivering more effective faculty development programs tailored to adult
learners.

What deters student ventures to enrol in an incubation center?
Dr Puran Singh
March 4, 2025
An incubation center plays a pivotal role in nurturing early-stage ventures by providing students with a range of programs that support idea development, prototyping, product development, market entry and business growth. For student entrepreneurs, these resources – mentors, infrastructure, finance – are indeed invaluable in turning ideas into viable businesses. However, according to the GUESSS 2023 Survey Report, 26% of the student entrepreneurs were enrolled with an incubation center.
This statistic raises an important question: Why aren’t a large majority of student entrepreneurs leveraging the resources offered by incubation centers? Alternatively, one can flip the question and ask – Why are incubators not tapping the potential of aspiring student entrepreneurs?
The first possible reason is that the students lack awareness. Many students are simply not aware of the incubation center or the support they offer. Secondly, students juggle several academic and extra-curriculuar commitments, in addition to their with entrepreneurial aspirations, creating time constaint. The incubation centers usually gauge startup’s progress in timelined milestones, which is overwhelming for students who haven’t yet transitioned to an entrepreneurial mindset. Third, those who consider approaching the incubator, often feel underprepared, fear rejection or embarrassment, and decide to delay incubation. Fourth, the formal setup of an incubation center can be intimidating for students who generally lack confidence. They find student-run clubs such as E-Cells rather more approachable, rather than a professionally run incubation center.
Now the important question is – How do we bridge this gap between student entrepreneurs and incubation centers? Incubation centers need to understand the student pscychology and proactively engage with aspiring student entrepreneurs, i.e., become more approachable and student-friendly. Lets review some ideas. First, incubation centers can engage directly with students through campus events. By participating in student-run clubs and organizations, and hosting workshops or pitch competitions, centers can make themselves more visible and approachable. Second, incubation centers should have tailored programs to meet the needs of nascent student startups. It may entail flexible, low-stakes opportunities for students to test their ideas and learn from their failures. The focus has to be on encouraging students to experiment, iterate, and refine their ideas in a safe environment, rather than expecting a thoroughly developed business model upfront. Third, physical accessibility is a crucial factor – Incubation centers should be physically located close to student activity areas, or at least have satellite office or an extension center close to student hostels/academic areas. It enhances students’ awareness, and enables students to drop by, learn about resources, and get involved with minimum logistical hurdles.
Another interesting way for students to being student engagement in campus is to tap into students’ diverse skills by offering internships, collaborative research, and event management opportunities. This creates a mutually beneficial relationship where students gain practical experience while helping the incubation centers run more effectively. More importantly, students get exposure to incubation operations and startup support programs, which may encourages them to startup.
Lastly, entrepreneurship has to become an extension of academic activity of students, with incubation centers as key partners in this venture creation process. The host institutions need to recognize important factor. Students are relatively more motivated to take up credit-based programs which creates more bandwidth for them to explore startup ideas.
So, bridging the disconnect between student entrepreneurs and incubation centers is not merely about increasing enrollment, it’s about fostering an enabling environment where students feel inspired, supported, and safe to explore entrepreneurship. This requires a mindset shift within incubation centers from being selective to becoming inclusive enablers of early potential. When institutions intentionally embed entrepreneurship into the academic fabric and make incubation centers integral to student life, they will unlock the true potential of the next generation of innovators.

Start Now or Start Later? A Friendly Face-Off on Student Entrepreneurship
Javeed Dar
May 28, 2025
Javeed Dar in conversation with Prof. Puran Singh, IIT Mandi and Vishwanath N, Arnetta Technologies
In the dynamic world of startups, one question resurfaces often, especially among student entrepreneurs: Should I start now, or should I gain some experience first? At first glance, both paths seem valid. But which one truly sets you up for long-term success?
The GUESSS India 2023 Survey brought out an interesting statistics related to this. 14% of Indian students intend to startup up right after graduating, while 31% say they will start five years later. To explore these two options further, we bring you a friendly and insightful debate between two seasoned voices:
Prof. Puran Singh, an academic who has enablered over 400 startups through IIT Mandi Catalyst – an incubator in Himachal Pradesh, and an ardent advocate for starting early.
Vishwanath N, an experienced corporate professional, who later turned entrepreneur. He has founded two successful ventures and believes in the power of real-world experience before starting a new venture.
Let us open the dialogue then!
1. Opportunity Cost vs Experience Gain
Javeed:
Let’s begin with the most debated issue — when is the right time to start? Is it better to dive in while you’re still a student or wait to build a base through experience?
Puran:
“Starting a venture while still in college is like planting a tree in fertile soil — there’s time, flexibility, and a safety net. The costs of failure are low. I’ve seen student founders bounce back from missteps and land top-tier opportunities, simply because they tried. The biggest loss isn’t a failed venture; it’s the missed learning if you never start.”
Vishwanath:
“That’s a fair point, Puran. But starting a company also means making hundreds of decisions — hiring, product strategy, finances — that you may not be equipped to handle yet. A few years in the workforce gives you the context and confidence to navigate these challenges. Experience doesn’t prevent mistakes, but it makes you better prepared to handle them.”
Javeed:
Those are solid points. While students may be able to compensate for lack of work experience with the support ecosystem, mentors, and professional help in their institution, how do they bridge lack of experience of leading people and teams. That brings me to the next question that focuses more on the individual: Are students personally ready for this leap?
2. Ecosystem Readiness vs Personal Readiness
Puran:
“The Indian student entrepreneurship ecosystem is the most supportive it’s ever been. With institute innovation councils (IICs), E-Cells, incubators, and government grants on campuses, it’s like the wind is at your back. If you’re waiting for a better timing, you may wait forever. Passion and commitment can go a long way especially with this fertile environment.”
Vishwanath:
“No doubt the ecosystem is enabling. But personal readiness is another story. Are you prepared for the grind? Can you handle the pressure of leading a team and managing finances with little to no buffer? These aren’t just operational questions — they’re emotional and psychological. And sometimes, maturity only comes with age and experience.”
Javeed:
Maturity is a key point. But so is learning. So let’s look at how each path teaches you differently. Is it better shaped by hands-on failure or structured exposure?
3. Learning Through Failure vs Learning Through Structure
Puran:
“There’s no better classroom than a startup. Every mistake is a mini-MBA. You learn customer empathy by being ignored, financial prudence by running out of money, and leadership by necessity. College is the time to build that thick skin, and it’s forgiving enough to allow second and third tries. And I have this ‘third venture’ theory where I argue that students must arrive at their third venture. Thats when they taste success.”
Vishwanath:
“I agree failure is a teacher, but structure has its place too. When you work in a high-performing company, you see how scalable systems are built, how teams collaborate effectively, and how markets respond to decisions. It’s like being a part of a well-oiled machine before you build your own. That foundation can be priceless.”
Javeed:
Great insights from both of you. The students have a lot to take away from this debate. Let’s shift gears a bit. No startup succeeds alone — let’s talk co-founders. Finding the right co-founder is often half the battle. Where does that happen more naturally — college or the workplace?
4. Finding Co-Founders
Puran:
“Campuses are incredible places to find co-founders. You’re surrounded by bright, driven people from different domains — tech, design, business, even humanities. You build trust working on class projects and competitions. The campus is where you have seen your peers, through all seasons, in their different colors. You can find most compatible co-founders in your hostel dorms.”
Vishwanath:
“That’s true, but shared passion in college doesn’t always translate to shared resilience in a startup. In a corporate job, you see how colleagues operate under real pressure — deadlines, accountability, shifting priorities. Those interactions reveal a lot more about who you’d actually want in the trenches with you.”
Moderator:
Interesting contrast there. Seems to be both approaches have pros and cons. Let’s talk next about building your professional circle — the people who can help you grow and back your ideas. Where do the most meaningful connections get made?
5. Building a Network
Puran:
“College networks are deeply underrated. Alumni can be incredibly generous, professors open doors, and guest speakers often become mentors. Our incubator’s best success stories often started with a conversation at a college event. Your network starts here if you know how to nurture it.”
Vishwanath:
“Yes, but it scales in the corporate world. You build industry-specific relationships, gain access to mentors who’ve seen decades of business evolution, and often meet future investors or partners. These networks are built on trust and execution — which comes with time and performance.”
Javeed:
Seems like both sides have strong arguments. But does it always have to be one or the other? Do we have a Middle Ground? Is There a Hybrid Path?
Interestingly, many successful founders started exploring entrepreneurship in college but launched their serious ventures after gaining some experience. They treated their college years as a sandbox — a time for experimentation — and their early jobs as finishing schools.
Students should take time to build side projects while in college. Participate in hackathons, join startup clubs, take internships in startups or venture capital firms. These experiences blur the line between the two camps. You’re starting and learning. You’re failing and preparing.
So, my closing thoughts are: It’s Not Either/Or — It’s About Fit. What should a student ultimately keep in mind?
Prof. Puran and Vishwanath don’t disagree on the ‘why’ of entrepreneurship — they are just debating the ‘when’. There’s no one right answer that applies to all students. Your path depends on your risk appetite, maturity, clarity of purpose, and support system.
If you have an idea that excites you and a team ready to build — go for it. If you want to gain experience and refine your thinking — that’s smart too. What matters is not when you start, but that you keep moving forward.
So, are you Team Puran or Team Vishwanath? Or maybe, you’re carving out your own timeline — and that’s perfectly okay too.
The crux is – starting up is a real career option for Indian students today!
